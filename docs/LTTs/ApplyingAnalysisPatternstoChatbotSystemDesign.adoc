== Overview

The lecture *Applying Analysis Patterns* expands on the relationship between ubiquitous language and analysis patterns during the development of the Sleevey chatbot for the platform.

While the previous lecture task focused on establishing shared vocabulary between designers and developers, this task shifts toward understanding how *recurring domain-level patterns* shape the conceptual model of the system.

The goal is not only consistency in communication but ensuring that the core concepts of the chatbot align with stable, business-oriented patterns rather than implementation details.

== Analysis Pattern Application

Marko Schütz-Schmuck describes analysis patterns as groups of concepts that represent common constructions in business modeling—providing reusable frameworks that guide decisions in domain modeling.

For the Sleevey chatbot, these patterns help reason about conversations and dialogue flow at a conceptual level.

Rather than focusing on application-level abstractions like API endpoints or React hooks, we interpret the chatbot’s behavior in terms of *domain interactions*: how a user engages in dialogue and how rules determine when the system produces a new conversational contribution.

| Analysis Pattern Concept
| Chatbot Domain Analogue
| Explanation

| Account / Entry / Transaction
| Conversation / Exchange / Turn
| Each conversational turn—whether from the chatbot or the user—acts as an immutable entry in a conversation ledger.

| Posting Rules
| Response Rules
| Response rules determine when the system must produce a new conversational turn (e.g., after a user input, or to maintain dialogue structure).

| Conservation Principle
| Context Integrity
| The conversation maintains coherent meaning by preserving all prior exchanges, enabling an interpretable, stable history.

== Pattern-Driven Design Reflection

Viewing Sleevey through analysis patterns encourages a conceptual model where conversational elements are treated as domain entities, not implementation artifacts.

* Each exchange becomes an "entry" contributing to a growing ledger of meaning.
* Response rules act as domain logic for when Sleevey produces the next conversational turn.
* Context continuity ensures that each turn aligns with the conversation’s existing structure.

This framework shows how *domain stability* and *communication clarity* reinforce each other.  
Analysis patterns define the conversation at the business-model level, while ubiquitous language ensures consistent terminology across roles.

== Design Integration

Even in the design layer, these patterns are reflected:

* Conversation flows represent sequences of exchanges.
* Each turn mirrors the entry-transaction structure by being recorded, contextualized, and preserved.
* The UI represents conversations as structured domain events rather than isolated responses.

== Conclusion

The combination of ubiquitous language and analysis patterns enriches the chatbot design process by maintaining a stable domain model for Sleevey.

These methods transform the chatbot from a set of interface components into a conceptual system of conversational transactions.  
Every dialogue becomes both an exchange and a structured domain event—bridging human conversation with business-oriented analysis patterns.

# Preliminary Database Schema for Donation Items

## Existing Platforms

### Amazon
#### Key Features
- Vast product catalog with strong categorization and filtering options (type, brand, size, condition, etc.)
- Integrated payment and delivery system with buyer protection
- Review system (buyers reviewing sellers and products)
- Strong recommendation engine (suggested items based on browsing history)

#### Areas for Improvement
- Focuses mainly on new products, making it less intuitive for second-hand/donation-based items
- High fees for sellers, which may not align with donation/low-cost goals
- Sustainability/donation aspects are not emphasized

### Etsy
#### Key Features
- Supports handmade, vintage, and unique items (closer to second-hand/donation model)
- Seller profiles with reviews and ratings
- Good categorization (tags, type, size, etc.)
- Search filters allow for style- and preference-based discovery

#### Areas for Improvement
- Focuses more on selling rather than donation (everything has a price tag)
- Discovery can still be cluttered if tags aren’t used well
- No standardized way to indicate **condition** of items (important for second-hand clothes)

### Shein
#### Key Features
- Very low-cost clothing options with easy browsing by category, size, and style
- Strong focus on images to influence buyer decisions
- Personalization/recommendations based on user preferences

#### Areas for Improvement
- Not a second-hand/donation platform at all—emphasizes fast fashion, which goes against sustainability
- No system for user-to-user selling/donating, only brand-to-consumer
- No transparency about condition or quality (everything is assumed "new")

### Poshmark
#### Key Features
- Marketplace dedicated to second-hand clothes
- Easy listing with pictures, condition, brand, and size
- Reviews and ratings between buyers and sellers

#### Areas for Improvement
- Strong emphasis on social media–style interactions (not always aligned with donation-only goals)
- Seller fees may discourage casual donators

### ThredUp
#### Key Features
- Online thrift/donation model focused on second-hand clothing
- Strong categorization by brand, size, style, and condition
- Sustainability message aligned with reuse and recycling of clothing
- Streamlined donation/selling process (clean-out kits for users)

#### Areas for Improvement
- Limited user-to-user interaction (platform acts as middleman)
- Not always transparent about item rejection or pricing strategy
- Focused more on resale than pure donation

_**Legend:**_ ★★★★ = Excellent, ★★★ = Good, ★★ = Fair, ★ = Poor

== Security Evaluation:
* **Stripe:** PCI DSS compliant, encryption at rest/in transit, Radar for fraud detection.
* **PayPal:** PCI DSS compliant, dispute resolution and seller/buyer protections.
* **ATH Móvil:** Secure and regulated locally, supports encrypted transactions; API-level fraud prevention tools less documented.  

== Developer Experience:
* **Stripe:** Comprehensive docs, test modes, excellent SDKs for multiple languages.
* **PayPal:** Solid docs but APIs feel older; integration can be less flexible.
* **ATH Móvil:** Business app provides dashboards; API/SDK support less mature and may require direct contact with Evertec for integration.

== Constraints & Risks:
* **Stripe/PayPal:** Higher fees but strong global coverage.
* **ATH Móvil:** Market-limited, documentation gaps, potential reliance on QR/app workflows.

== Recommendations:
* **Primary Provider:** Stripe is the best global reach, features, and developer experience.
* **Backup Provider:** PayPal is a widely trusted fallback option.
* **Supplementary Local Provider:** ATH Móvil is strongly recommended for Puerto Rico-based customers to maximize adoption and reduce costs locally.

== High-Level Setup Steps:
. Create merchant accounts.
. Enable sandbox/test environments.
. Generate API keys and configure webhook endpoints.
. Coordinate with Evertec for ATH Móvil integration details.
. Implement transaction workflows: checkout, refunds, cancellations.
. Test across currencies and payment methods.

== Potential Risks & Limitations:
* **Stripe/PayPal:** Higher costs, occasional regional restrictions.
* **ATH Móvil:** Limited scope, unclear long-term API/SDK support, requires customer adoption of the ATH Móvil app.

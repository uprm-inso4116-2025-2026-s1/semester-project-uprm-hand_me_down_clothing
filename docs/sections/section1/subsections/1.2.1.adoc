==== *1.2.1 Current Situation*
===== Landfills and textile waste in Puerto Rico

* High waste volume: Approximately 250 million pounds of clothing and textiles are sent to Puerto Rico's landfills annually.

* High landfill rate: Similar to the global and U.S. trends, a very high percentage of discarded textiles, around 85%, end up in landfills, despite being largely recyclable.

* Low recycling rates: Puerto Rico's overall recycling rate is notably low, with some reports estimating it to be less than 10%. This is significantly lower than the U.S. national average.

* Overwhelmed landfills: Puerto Rico's landfills are facing a serious crisis, with many already at or over capacity. The high volume of textile waste contributes to this problem.

===== Poverty

* Overall Poverty: The poverty rate in Puerto Rico is alarmingly high, at around 41.7% as of 2022. This is over three times the U.S. national average.

* Child Poverty: A staggering 54.3% to 57.6% of children under 18 in Puerto Rico live in poverty. This is more than any U.S. state and indicates that a vast number of families cannot afford to consistently provide their children with properly fitting, weather-appropriate clothing and shoes.

* Persistent Poverty: All 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico are classified as "persistent poverty counties," meaning they have maintained a poverty rate of 20% or more for at least 30 years.

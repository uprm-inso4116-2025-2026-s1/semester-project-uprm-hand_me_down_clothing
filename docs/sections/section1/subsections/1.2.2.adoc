=== *1.2.2 Need*
The purpose of this section is to establish the fundamental needs that
motivate the Hand Me Down project, expressed independently of any
system-to-be. These needs are grounded in the resale domain and must
reflect the concerns of students and families who participate in
secondhand exchanges. The articulation of these needs will guide the
subsequent development of domain descriptions, requirements, software
architecture, and testing activities.

Stakeholders in this domain shall be understood as students and families
seeking opportunities for affordable, accessible, and trustworthy
secondhand exchanges. Their needs are not for a platform itself, but for
solutions to the problems they encounter when attempting to exchange
goods in local communities.

The following distinct needs are identified:

* Students and families must have affordable access to secondhand goods
  that support daily life, education, and well-being.
* Stakeholders must be able to rely on transparent information about the
  condition and history of pre-owned items.
* Exchanges shall be conducted in a manner that establishes trust,
  fairness, and safety between participants.
* Opportunities for accessibility and inclusivity must be available so
  that all families and students, regardless of economic background,
  will participate in the resale domain without barriers.
* Developers shall have clear requirements, descriptions, and
  architecture to build upon, since no structured system currently
  exists to organize this resale context.

These needs form the foundation for further project work. They are
deliberately expressed at the domain level, independently of any
particular solution, to ensure that subsequent design and implementation
activities will remain aligned with the stakeholders underlying
motivations.

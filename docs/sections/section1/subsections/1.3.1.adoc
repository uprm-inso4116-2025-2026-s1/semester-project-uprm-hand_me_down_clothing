* Architecture:: Defining a framework that supports secure and scalable interactions between sellers and buyers.
* Project Activities:: Documentation, validation, and design processes that must accompany implementation.

==== Span
The span narrows the focus of the Hand Me Down project to *specific concerns and audiences* within the general resale domain.
The platform must primarily serve individuals and families who wish to exchange items affordably, students and young adults seeking budget-friendly goods, and community members interested in sustainable consumption.

The span includes the following project-specific aspects:

* User Interaction:: Individuals must be able to list, browse, and search for secondhand items.
* Categorization:: Items will be organized into categories that facilitate discovery.
* Transaction Support:: The system must provide structured means for [.changed]#creating and viewing listings, including optional prices or donation markers. Negotiation and exchange are arranged outside the platform.#

=== *2.1 Domain Description*

The domain of *hand-me-down clothing exchange* in Puerto Rico is shaped by social,  
environmental, and economic realities. It exists independently of any digital platform  
or technical system and can be understood through the people, practices, artifacts,  
and norms that sustain the circulation of clothing and accessories among students,  
families, and local communities.

At its core, the domain revolves around two primary actors:

* *Sellers*: Individuals or households who post garments they no longer need, offering them for reuse or resale.  
* *Buyers*: Individuals who discover these garments through listings and arrange exchanges directly with the seller, outside the system.

The central entity in this domain is the *Piece*, any individual article of clothing or  
accessory that circulates between actors. Each Piece carries attributes such as:

* *Type*: The category of clothing.  
* *Condition Rating*: A measure of quality or usability.

Meanwhile, a *Listing* is a published representation of a Piece in the platform.
Listings move between states through events:

* *Listing Published*: Occurs when a Seller makes a garment visible to potential Buyers.  
* *Interest Expressed*: Occurs when a Buyer contacts a Seller regarding a listed garment.  
* *Listing Closed*: Occurs when a garment has been exchanged offline or removed from visibility.  
* *Discard Event*: Occurs when a Piece leaves circulation, feeding into the wider *Textile Waste Stream*.

The domain is sustained by informal practices and behaviors:

* *Discovery Flows*: The recurring sequence in which garments are listed, browsed, and handed over in person.  
* *Condition Disclosure Norms*: The expectation that Sellers will show tag photos, highlight defects, and represent garments honestly.  
* *Informal Price Bands*: Symbolic or suggested valuations (typically USD $8–$15), distinguishing resale from donation or commercial sale.  
* *Dormant Stock*: Clothing stored in homes awaiting redistribution, resale, or disposal.  
* *Meetup Spots*: Semi-public locations (e.g., campus benches, apartment lobbies) chosen for exchanges.  
* *Ad-hoc Channels*: Informal digital venues (e.g., Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp groups, Instagram stories).  
* *Trust Cues*: Bilingual communication, recognizable names, or clear photos that influence whether an exchange proceeds.  
* *Seasonal Demand Pulses*: Cyclical increases in demand, such as back-to-school or weather-driven surges for uniforms or outerwear.

These elements form an interconnected web of events, actions, and behaviors.  
Sellers and Buyers rely on ad-hoc digital channels for discovery, agree on terms through direct contact, and meet in semi-public spaces to exchange items offline.  
Exchanges are underpinned by implicit rules of trust and fairness, while also  
constrained by larger social and environmental forces such as poverty rates,  
limited recycling infrastructure, and overflowing landfills.

From a functional perspective, the domain can be represented through abstract operations:

* `publishListing(Piece, Seller, Locale) → ListingPublished`  
* `bookmarkListing(Listing, Buyer) → ListingBookmarked`  
* `expressInterest(Listing, Buyer) → InterestExpressed`  
* `rate(Piece, ConditionRating) → ConditionRating`  
* `review(Seller, Buyer, Review) → ReviewSubmitted`  
* `categorize(Piece, Type) → Piece`  
* `closeListing(Listing) → ListingClosed`

Each function captures an action that transforms the state of a *Listing* or *Piece* within the domain,  
producing observable changes such as entering circulation, connecting interested parties, or leaving visibility once the exchange occurs offline.

In sum, the domain of secondhand clothing discovery in Puerto Rico is defined by the  
*visibility of Pieces*, the *actors who list and find them*, the *events that mark transitions*,  
and the *behaviors and norms* that make these exchanges trustworthy, affordable,  
and sustainable. This description provides a foundation for later requirements  
and design work, while remaining independent of any specific system or implementation.

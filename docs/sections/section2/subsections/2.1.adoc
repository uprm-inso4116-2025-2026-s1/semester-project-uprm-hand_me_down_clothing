== 2 Descriptive Part

=== *2.1 Domain Description*

The domain of *hand-me-down clothing exchange* in Puerto Rico is shaped by social, 
environmental, and economic realities. It exists independently of any digital platform 
or technical system and can be understood through the people, practices, artifacts, 
and norms that sustain the circulation of clothing and accessories among students, 
families, and local communities.

At its core, the domain revolves around two primary actors:

* *Donators*: Individuals or households who release garments they no longer need.
* *Collectors*: Individuals who claim garments for reuse, whether through purchase or donation.

The central entity in this domain is the *Piece*, any individual article of clothing or 
accessory that circulates between actors. Each Piece carries attributes such as:

* *Type*: The category of clothing.
* *Condition Rating*: A measure of quality or usability.

Pieces move between states through events:

* *Donation Event*: Occurs when a Donator makes a garment available.
* *Collection Event*: Occurs when a Collector takes possession of a garment.
* *Discard Event*: Occurs when a Piece leaves circulation, feeding into the wider *Textile Waste Stream*.

The domain is sustained by informal practices and behaviors:

* *Exchange Flows*: The recurring sequence in which garments are identified, 
  negotiated, and handed over in person.
* *Condition Disclosure Norms*: The expectation that Donators will show tag photos, 
  highlight defects, and represent garments honestly.
* *Student Resale Price Bands*: Informal valuation brackets (typically USD $8–$15), 
  distinguishing resale from donation or commercial sale.
* *Dormant Stock*: Clothing stored in homes awaiting redistribution, donation, or disposal.
* *Meetup Spots*: Semi-public locations (e.g., campus benches, apartment lobbies) 
  chosen for exchanges.
* *Ad-hoc Channels*: Informal digital venues (e.g., Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp groups, Instagram stories).
* *Trust Cues*: Bilingual communication, recognisable names, or clear photos that 
  influence whether an exchange proceeds.
* *Seasonal Demand Pulses*: Cyclical increases in demand, such as back-to-school 
  or weather-driven surges for uniforms or outerwear.

These elements form an interconnected web of events, actions, and behaviors. 
Donators and Collectors rely on ad-hoc digital channels for discovery, agree on 
terms through negotiation, and meet in semi-public spaces to transfer items. 
Exchanges are underpinned by implicit rules of trust and fairness, while also 
constrained by larger social and environmental forces such as poverty rates, 
limited recycling infrastructure, and overflowing landfills.

From a functional perspective, the domain can be represented through abstract operations:

* `donate(Piece, Donator, Locale) → DonationEvent`
* `collect(Piece, Collector) → CollectionEvent`
* `rate(Piece, ConditionRating) → ConditionRating`
* `review(Collection, Review) → Review`
* `categorize(Piece, Type) → Piece`
* `discard(Piece) → Void`

Each function captures an action that transforms the state of a *Piece* within the domain, 
producing observable changes such as entering circulation, changing ownership, or leaving circulation.

In sum, the domain of secondhand clothing exchange in Puerto Rico is defined by the 
*circulation of Pieces*, the *actors who exchange them*, the *events that mark transitions*, 
and the *behaviors and norms* that make these exchanges trustworthy, affordable, 
and sustainable. This description provides a foundation for later requirements 
and design work, while remaining independent of any specific system or implementation.

=== *2.3.1 Selected Fragments of the Implementation*
This section provides selected fragments of the implementation that complement the architecture described in Section 2.3.  
To comply with project guidelines, the fragments are organized into:

1. **Implemented Fragments** – Functionality already built and connected to Supabase.  
2. **Planned Fragments** – UI prototypes that illustrate intended behavior or domain mappings but are not yet implemented.

Screenshots are used *only when they illuminate architectural decisions, domain flows, or state transitions*, not as user-manual illustrations.

=== **Implemented Fragments**

==== Home Page (Implemented UI Fragment)
image::HomePage.png[Home Page (Implemented Fragment), align=center, pdfwidth=80%]

*Caption:* *This screenshot demonstrates the implemented binding between React state and Supabase listing data. It is included because it shows how the Home Page retrieves the most recent active listings and displays them as part of the implemented browsing flow.*

The implemented Home Page fragment:
- fetches active listings from Supabase,  
- displays them in a scrollable feed, and  
- provides navigation to other implemented features (e.g., listing creation, browsing feed).

This fragment demonstrates how the frontend consumes application-level domain functions such as `browseAvailableItems`.

==== Clothing Listing Page (Implemented UI Fragment)
image::ListingsPage.png[Listings Page (Implemented Fragment), align=center, pdfwidth=80%]

*Caption:* *Included to show the operational flow from a Supabase “active listings” query into a React-rendered list component. This directly reflects the domain’s browsing functions.*

This implemented component:
- loads available listings using Supabase filters,  
- displays listing metadata (title, image, free/resale marker), and  
- supports client-side sorting.

These elements correspond directly to domain actions such as filtering and browsing available items.

==== Item Upload Flow – Implemented Logic
image::HandMeDown_ItemUpload.png[Item Upload Flow (Implemented Logic), align=center]

*Caption:* *Flowchart included to illustrate the implemented control flow from the React form to Supabase Storage and Database. This visualization explains the domain-level `publishListing` action and its mapping to the current backend logic.*

Implemented behaviors include:
1. Authenticated user opens the listing creation form.  
2. Required fields validated client-side.  
3. Images uploaded to Supabase Storage.  
4. Listing inserted into the database with `status = active`.  

This flow enforces domain invariants but **does not** create or manage transactions.

'''

=== **Planned Fragments**

*(These pages are not yet implemented; they serve to document intended architectural fit. No user-manual behavior is described.)*

==== Item Detail Page (Planned UI Fragment)
image::IndividualListing.png[Planned Item Detail Page, align=center, pdfwidth=80%]

*Caption:* *This prototype is included because it illustrates how domain entities (Listing, Seller, Review summary) will map to a unified detail view once fully implemented.*

This planned view will integrate:
- listing metadata,  
- seller information,  
- interest/contact actions tied to the domain event `InterestExpressed`.  

No backend logic exists yet.

'''

==== Map Page (Planned UI Fragment)
image::Map1.png[Map Prototype 1, align=center]
image::Map2.png[Map Prototype 2, align=center]
image::Map3.png[Map Prototype 3, align=center]

*Caption:* *These prototypes illustrate the architectural role of the map: integrating Supabase-stored locations with Leaflet. They are included only to show planned frontend–database interactions, not to document UI behavior.*

The map will integrate:
- Leaflet for geospatial rendering,  
- Supabase for donation-center metadata,  
- optional geocoding services.

This fragment is architectural only; full functionality is not implemented.

=== Summary
This section now distinguishes implemented behavior from planned prototypes and uses screenshots strictly to illustrate architectural or domain-relevant flows. All user-manual descriptions have been removed, aligning the documentation with Milestone 3 expectations.

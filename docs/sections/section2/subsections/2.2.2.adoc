=== *2.2.2 - Personas*

A persona is a fictional yet plausible representation of a user within the platform’s ecosystem. The following personas illustrate different motivations, behaviors, and constraints to help align development goals with user needs.  
They represent typical users participating in the *listing and discovery* of secondhand clothing, where all exchanges and payments occur directly between parties, outside the system.


*Adriana Gómez*

- *Age*: 20 years old  
- *Occupation*: University student on financial aid working part-time on campus  
- *Build / Appearance*: Dark, straight hair; average height; dresses in vintage clothes and colorful accessories  
- *Personality*: Creative, expressive, community-driven  

Adriana loves expressing herself through unique outfits. She often mixes styles and prefers pre-owned or vintage pieces that stand out from mainstream fashion. However, she finds it difficult to locate affordable, distinctive items near Mayagüez since many local thrift stores have little to no online presence. Between classes and her part-time job, she has limited time to explore in person, so she depends on quick, mobile-friendly browsing and local visibility through verified sellers. 

- *Pain Points*: Limited access to local secondhand clothing options; lack of time to search physically; difficulty finding one-of-a-kind pieces online.  
- *Needs*: A trusted and time-efficient way to browse nearby listings from verified local sellers and individuals offering unique or free clothing.  
- *Platform Interaction*: Scrolls listings during short study breaks, saves her favorite posts, and messages sellers when something catches her eye. She occasionally leaves reviews to help other buyers identify reliable sellers.  
- *Domain Role*: Buyer; contributes to trust and discovery behaviors through reviews and recurring interactions.

Manuel is preparing to move apartments and wants to downsize.

He wants a simple, local way to share listings that reach nearby users without managing payments inside the platform.

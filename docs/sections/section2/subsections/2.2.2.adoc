=== *2.2.2 — Personas*

Personas are fictional but plausible representations of stakeholders in the domain.  
They help justify requirements by grounding them in the observed needs, constraints, and behaviors of real people who participate in or are affected by the hand-me-down clothing ecosystem.  

Personas are **not limited to direct platform users**; any stakeholder who influences or benefits from the domain can serve as a persona.  
Each persona below includes a brief biography, goals, pain points, needs, and the areas of the platform or domain design where they provide insight.

== *Direct-User Personas*

=== *Adriana Gómez — Buyer*

- *Age:* 20  
- *Occupation:* University student on financial aid; part-time campus worker  
- *Appearance:* Dark straight hair, low–average height, vintage aesthetic  
- *Personality:* Creative, expressive, community-minded  

Adriana uses fashion as a form of identity and expression. She frequently seeks unique, older garments but lacks time to visit local thrift stores due to academic and work responsibilities. She depends on digital tools to discover items efficiently.

- *Goals:* Build an affordable, expressive wardrobe  
- *Pain Points:* Limited local thrift options; time constraints; inconsistent online visibility  
- *Needs:* Trustworthy online listings; discovery tools that surface unique items  
- *Interaction Pattern:* Browses from her phone in short intervals between classes  
- *Design Relevance:* Guides the structure of category filters, listing layout, and search tooling

=== *Manuel Torres — Seller*

- *Age:* 35  
- *Occupation:* Middle school teacher  
- *Appearance:* Curly brown hair, average height, casual polos and graphic tees  
- *Personality:* Patient, humorous, practical  

Manuel is preparing to move and prefers to give his clothing a second life rather than discarding it. He is motivated by reducing waste and recouping modest value but lacks a simple and reliable way to list items.

- *Goals:* Streamline the moving process while extending item usefulness  
- *Pain Points:* No convenient channel to sell used clothes locally  
- *Needs:* Straightforward listing creation and editing; low friction workflows  
- *Interaction Pattern:* Creates listings from his work computer during breaks  
- *Design Relevance:* Informs listing creation, editing flows, and status transitions (active → reserved → sold/donated/retracted)

=== *Daniela López — Buyer with Sustainability Focus*

- *Age:* 27  
- *Occupation:* Nurse practitioner  
- *Appearance:* Tall, wavy brunette hair, comfortable athleisure style  
- *Personality:* Eco-conscious, outspoken, deliberate decision-maker  

Daniela avoids fast fashion and prioritizes durable vintage items. After the closure of her preferred thrift store, she now relies on digital discovery tools to maintain access to quality second-hand clothing.

- *Goals:* Convenient access to durable, quality garments  
- *Pain Points:* Lack of local sustainable clothing options; declining item quality in major retailers  
- *Needs:* Effective filters to identify high-quality, durable items  
- *Interaction Pattern:* Uses search + filtering extensively  
- *Design Relevance:* Validates the need for category guidance, condition indicators, and strong filtering capabilities

---

== *Domain-Level Personas (Indirect Stakeholders)*

These roles help justify requirements beyond simple buyer/seller interactions, especially around **sustainability**, **visibility**, and **community support mechanisms**.

=== *Isidra Montoya — Local Thrift Store Owner*

- *Age:* 61  
- *Occupation:* Thrift store owner  
- *Appearance:* Short stature, white pixie-cut hair, practical clothing  
- *Personality:* Warm, welcoming, diligent  

Isidra’s shop has limited visibility due to its location and her low digital literacy. Community members occasionally upload her shop to the platform’s thrift-store map, indirectly increasing her reach.

- *Pain Points:* Low visibility; limited digital outreach  
- *Needs:* Community-driven discovery mechanisms; intuitive interfaces  
- *Interaction Pattern:* Does not use the platform directly but benefits from being discoverable through it  
- *Design Relevance:* Supports map-related features, community contribution flows, and accessibility-first design considerations

---

=== *Fernando Ruiz — Community Organizer*

- *Age:* 29  
- *Occupation:* Event organizer and nonprofit volunteer  
- *Appearance:* Tall, medium build, short hair dyed blue at the tips  
- *Personality:* Energetic, charismatic, service-oriented  

Fernando organizes monthly clothing drives, but donation volume is often insufficient due to low public awareness. When users add his events to the community map, drive participation increases.

- *Pain Points:* Insufficient visibility for donation events  
- *Needs:* Platforms that amplify donation opportunities  
- *Interaction Pattern:* Indirect beneficiary of user-generated map entries  
- *Design Relevance:* Helps justify donation-specific flows, map event visibility, and clear distinction between resale vs donation in the domain (supports REQ-DR3)

---

== *Purpose of Personas*

These personas ensure that requirements:

- reflect the motivations and constraints of real actors,  
- support sustainability and circular-economy practices,  
- consider privacy vs transparency trade-offs,  
- address both direct interactions and indirect community benefits,  
- remain grounded in the actual domain phenomena observed during rough-sketch analysis.

Personas thus serve as anchors connecting the domain understanding to the requirements and later design decisions.

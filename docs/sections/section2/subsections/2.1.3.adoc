=== *2.1.3 — Domain Terminology in Relation to Domain Rough*

This section explains how the terminology in §2.1.2 was derived from the raw observations in the Domain Rough Sketch (§2.1.1). The goal is to document the transformation from informal descriptions to stable domain concepts. Each term is tagged with its conceptual category (Behavior, Action, Norm, Setting, Entity, Value Object).

---

==== *Exchange Flow* (Behavior)

Students repeatedly described a sequence: discover item → contact seller → clarify details → meet → exchange.  
We abstracted this into **Exchange Flow**, a Behavior pattern representing the typical order of actions in informal garment handoffs.

---

==== *Condition Disclosure Norm* (Norm)

Multiple stories included showing defects, tags, or wear. These reflect a **Norm**: sellers are expected to disclose condition accurately. It is a social rule, not an action.

---

==== *Student Resale Price Band* (Value Object)

Mentions of “symbolic prices” created a recognizable interval of acceptable low-cost pricing. This became **Student Resale Price Band**, a Value Object representing a shared reference range.

---

==== *Textile Waste Stream* (Environmental Phenomenon)

References to donated, discarded, or reused clothing reflect the end-of-life pathways of garments. We abstracted this into **Textile Waste Stream**, a phenomenon describing how clothing leaves circulation.

---

==== *Dormant Stock* (State / Entity Condition)

Stories of bags of unused clothes indicated items in limbo.  
We named this **Dormant Stock**, representing a Piece that exists physically but is not in active circulation.

---

==== *Meetup Spot* (Setting)

Campus benches, bus stops, and parking lots were repeatedly used as handoff locations.  
These became **Meetup Spot**, a Setting where Exchange Flow steps occur.

---

==== *Ad-hoc Channel* (Communication Setting)

Students negotiated via WhatsApp, Marketplace, Instagram stories, etc. We unified these into **Ad-hoc Channel**, a medium enabling discovery and negotiation.

---

==== *Trust Cue* (Value Object / Signal)

Recognizable names, bilingual communication, and clear photos all served as signals of reliability.  
These became **Trust Cues** — interpreted signals aiding decision-making.

---

==== *Seasonal Demand Pulse* (Environmental/Market Behavior)

Demand surges around semester beginnings or weather changes created cyclical patterns.  
We abstracted this into **Seasonal Demand Pulse**, describing market-level fluctuations.

---

These derived terms now serve as the conceptual foundation for the deeper analysis in §3.1, ensuring that the vocabulary used in the domain model originates directly from observed practices.

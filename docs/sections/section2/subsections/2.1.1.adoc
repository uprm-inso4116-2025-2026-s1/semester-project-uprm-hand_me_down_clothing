=== *2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketches*

This section documents raw, observable examples of clothing exchange and discovery as they occur in daily life. These anecdotes are early insights and do not interpret or generalize; they simply record what was seen or described.

==== Example 1: Adriana’s Search for Affordable Outfits
Adriana, a 20-year-old UPRM student, needs new outfits for an upcoming presentation but cannot afford retail prices. She opens a local Facebook group called “UPRM Ropa y Accesorios” and scrolls through the feed.  
She spots a post titled *“Blazer, lightly used, $10”* with photos showing the tag and sleeves. Adriana messages the seller in Spanish: *“¿Todavía lo tienes disponible?”* The seller responds quickly and confirms that the blazer is still available. They agree to meet at the main campus entrance the next afternoon. Adriana checks the garment in person, pays in cash, and the seller later marks the post as “Sold.”  
The entire flow—scrolling, messaging, coordinating, and closing—happened outside any dedicated app, relying solely on informal trust and visible cues like clear photos and quick replies.

==== Example 2: Manuel’s Donation After Semester End
Manuel, a middle school teacher and UPRM alumnus, sorts his closet at the end of the semester. He finds several shirts in good condition but no longer wears them. He takes photos, labels them *“Free for pickup near UPRM apartments”*, and posts them in a WhatsApp group where local students trade items.  
Within hours, a student replies: *“Can I pick up tomorrow morning?”* Manuel agrees, places the items in a bag labeled “Free clothes,” and leaves them at his apartment lobby. By afternoon, the bag is gone. No money exchanged hands, and no platform intervention was needed — only quick, direct communication and mutual trust.  

==== Observed Raw Facts
- Listings often use informal phrases like “lightly used,” “like new,” and “free.”  
- Meetups happen in semi-public, familiar places.  
- Sellers use photos as proof of honesty (tags, condition, size).  
- Prices are symbolic and flexible ($8–$15 typical range).  
- Listings and messages are bilingual; Spanish often dominates the first contact.  
- Exchanges rely on visibility and responsiveness rather than any formal guarantee.  

These examples illustrate the recurring pattern of discovery → contact → agreement → exchange that underlies the entire secondhand clothing domain.

=== *2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketches*
:location: Mayagüez, Puerto Rico (UPRM touchpoint)
:period: 2025

This section captures domain facts, phrases, anecdotes, and observations.
It SHALL NOT mention features or designs of any future system.
Interviews with external stakeholders are pending.

==== Stakeholder & Settings
* Team self-observation (students), Mayagüez/UPRM: identified a recurring need for affordable access to clothing and accessories among students and families.
* *No interviews conducted yet.* Contacts to schedule: students, families, school/university staff, local resale participants.

==== Observed Practices
* Discovery: Facebook Marketplace, Facebook groups, WhatsApp groups, Instagram stories.
* Handoff: in-person meetups at UPRM (on/near campus) or at apartment complexes.
* Typical flow (as reported by students): look up item → contact seller → agree on specifics (price, size, time/place) → meet in person to exchange the item.  
  The agreement on price and pickup is handled entirely by the users outside any system.

==== Artifacts, Condition Language, and Pricing
* Item types seen/expected: all kinds of clothing and accessories (no restricted categories observed yet).
* Condition/fit phrasing used: “lightly used,” “like new,” and explicit size labeling.
* Typical price range mentioned for clothing items: USD $8–$15, treated as an informal or symbolic resale range for students.

==== Trust, Safety, and Informal Norms
* Common concerns: item hygiene, no-shows, scams, and unsafe meetups.
* Informal norms reported: include a **photo of the size tag**, full-item photos (front/back/defects), and respond promptly.
* Moderation: minimal to none in ad-hoc chats; Facebook groups *may* apply basic moderation or post approval (to confirm).

==== Language & Access
* Languages used: Spanish + English (bilingual exchanges common).
* Access barriers reported so far: none explicitly identified by team; requires external confirmation.

==== Existing Channels (local)
* Facebook Marketplace (general Mayagüez and student-adjacent listings).
* Facebook groups (specific group names to be gathered during interviews).
* WhatsApp groups/lists (student and family circles).
* Instagram stories (peer-to-peer sharing).
* Moderation/ownership of channels: typically user- or admin-managed groups; to verify.

==== Micro-notes / Anecdotal Fragments
* Price sensitivity remains high; low-cost clothing listings ($8–$15) are the usual reference point for students.
* Meetups generally occur in familiar, semi-public locations such as campus benches or apartment lobbies.
* Sellers are expected to show **tag photos** and **clear images** of items; size miscommunication is a recurring issue.
* Exchanges happen quickly once contact is established — often same-day or next-day pickup.

==== Open Questions (for later concept analysis)
* Which groups or chat channels are most active in Mayagüez/UPRM, and who moderates them?
* What concrete safety practices are considered “standard” locally (meetup spots, daylight hours, bringing a friend, ID at gates)?
* How is *condition* described locally beyond “lightly used/like new”? (e.g., semester-used uniforms, visible defects, hygiene notes)
* Are there predictable seasonal peaks (back-to-school, semester start, graduation, weather shifts)? Which items surge in demand?
* For pricing, when do buyers and sellers treat $8–$15 as “firm” vs. negotiable (OBO, bundles)?
* Are there categories socially excluded (e.g., certain intimate apparel), and how do participants communicate those boundaries?
* Does the primary language (Spanish vs. English) of a listing or message affect engagement or trust among participants?

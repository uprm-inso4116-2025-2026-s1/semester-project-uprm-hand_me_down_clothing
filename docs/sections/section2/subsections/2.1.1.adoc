=== *2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketches*
:location: Mayagüez, Puerto Rico (UPRM touchpoint)
:period: 2025 

This section captures domain facts, phrases, anecdotes, and observations.
It SHALL NOT mention features or designs of any future system.
Interviews with external stakeholders are pending.

==== Stakeholder & Settings
* Team self-observation (students), Mayagüez/UPRM: identified a recurring need for affordable access to clothing/accessories among students and families.
* *No interviews conducted yet.* Contacts to schedule: students, families, school/university staff, local resale participants.

==== Observed Practices 
* Discovery: Facebook Marketplace; Facebook groups; WhatsApp groups; Instagram stories.
* Handoff: in-person meetups at UPRM (on/near campus) or at apartment complexes.
* Typical flow (as reported by students): look up item → contact seller → agree on specifics (price, size, time/place) → pick up item. Price agreement is informational and not processed by the platform.

==== Artifacts, Condition Language, and Pricing
* Item types seen/expected: any clothing and accessories (no narrow category observed yet).
* Condition/fit phrasing used: “lightly used,” “like new,” *specific sizes* (size called out explicitly).
* Typical price bracket mentioned for clothing items: USD $8–$15 (symbolic/low-cost resale).

==== Trust, Safety, and Informal Norms
* Common concerns: item hygiene; no-shows; scams; unsafe meetups.
* Informal norms reported: include a photo of the size **tag**; include full-item photos (front/back/defects).
* Moderation: none observed in ad-hoc chats; Facebook groups *may* have basic moderation/house rules (unverified; needs follow-up).

==== Language & Access
* Languages used: Spanish + English (bilingual exchanges common).
* Access barriers reported so far: none explicitly identified by team; requires external confirmation.

==== Existing Channels (local)
* Facebook Marketplace (general Mayagüez and student-adjacent listings).
* Facebook groups (names to be captured during interviews).
* WhatsApp groups/lists (parent/student circles).
* Instagram stories (peer-to-peer sharing).
* Moderation/ownership of channels: unknown (except Facebook-controlled groups); to verify.

==== Micro-notes / Anecdotal Fragments 
* Price sensitivity appears high; low-cost clothing listings ($8–$15) are common reference points among students.
* Meetups tend to prefer familiar, semi-public locations (campus spots, apartment lobbies).
* Sellers are expected to show a **tag photo** and **full product photos**; size clarity is a frequent pain point.

==== Open Questions (for later concept analysis)
* Which specific groups/chats drive most exchanges in Mayagüez/UPRM? Who moderates them and what rules exist?
* What concrete safety practices are considered “standard” locally (meetup spots, daylight hours, bringing a friend, ID at gates)?
* How is *condition* defined locally beyond “lightly used/like new”? (e.g., semester-used uniforms, defect call-outs, hygiene steps)
* Are there seasonal peaks (back-to-school, semester start, graduation, weather shifts)? What items spike, and when?
* For pricing, when do buyers/sellers treat $8–$15 as “firm” vs. negotiable (OBO, bundles)?
* Are there categories explicitly excluded by social norms (e.g., certain intimate apparel), and how is that communicated?
* Which language (Spanish vs. English) dominates in each channel, and does that affect participation?

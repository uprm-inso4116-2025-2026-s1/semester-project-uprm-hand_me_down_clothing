=== *2.1.4 Domain Narrative*

In Puerto Rico, informal clothing exchanges are a normal part of student and family life.  
Individuals frequently use social media to find or offer clothing items and arrange in-person meetups.  
The domain captured by this project represents those existing behaviors, listing, discovery, communication, and offline exchange rather than creating new ones.

Sellers create posts or listings to share available garments, often including details such as size, condition, and photos.  
Buyers search or browse listings, then contact sellers through direct messages to express interest.  
Once both parties agree, they meet in person to complete the exchange.  
Afterward, sellers may close their listings, and buyers may leave a review describing their experience.

All exchanges happen directly between users, outside the platform.  
The platform’s role is limited to:

* making listings visible

* enabling efficient search and filtering  

* supporting communication through messaging.

The domain also includes secondary practices such as saving listings for later, checking reviews for trust, and adjusting a listing’s visibility (active, reserved, closed).  
Together, these elements describe a clear, observable cycle of activity: *publish → discover → contact → exchange offline → close*.  
The system reflects this real-world rhythm without modeling payment, ownership, or physical handoffs.

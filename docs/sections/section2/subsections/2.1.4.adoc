==== *2.1.4 Domain Narrative*

In Puerto Rico, the flow of clothing and accessories between individuals and families is shaped by pressing social, economic, and environmental realities. Each year, hundreds of millions of pounds of garments and textiles are discarded, adding to the nation’s mounting waste crisis and overwhelming local landfills. Despite the recyclability of most textiles, the majority end up as landfill waste, a reflection of both limited recycling infrastructure and a culture still transitioning toward sustainability. At the same time, clothing represents a basic need—one that is often out of reach for families facing high rates of poverty and for individuals experiencing homelessness. Within this context, the exchange of pre-owned items is not a marginal activity, but a vital process that supports daily life, education, dignity, and well-being.

The domain of secondhand clothing exchange involves a variety of actors and natural processes. Donators—individuals or families with surplus or outgrown clothing—choose to make these items available for others, motivated by a mix of generosity, sustainability, and the desire to reduce waste. Before donating, a Donator may inspect each Piece for cleanliness and condition, sometimes annotating the garment with information about its type, fit, or history. Clothing is gathered and prepared for transfer, either to a known recipient or to a local organization or collection point (Locale). The act of donation is marked as a Donation event, signifying the moment a Piece enters the shared pool of resources accessible to the community.

Collectors—those seeking clothing and accessories—approach these shared spaces with specific needs or in hopes of finding unexpected treasures. A Collector may be a student whose family cannot afford frequent purchases, a parent searching for appropriate school attire, or an individual experiencing homelessness who relies on donated garments for protection against the elements. When evaluating Pieces, Collectors typically consider both the Condition Rating and the suitability of the item to their needs. The interaction is often personal and direct: questions may be asked about the garment’s wear, stories exchanged regarding its previous use, and informal advice offered about care or fit. Upon deciding to take an item, the act of Collection occurs, with the Collector assuming responsibility for the Piece and potentially providing feedback or a Review to acknowledge the utility or quality of the donation.

These exchanges are embedded in a broader cycle of reuse and redistribution. Items may pass through multiple hands and locales, with each transition adding to the collective history of the garment. Some pieces return to the cycle after outgrowing their current owner, while others are adapted or repaired to extend their lifespan. The community sustains informal norms of trust, fairness, and transparency—Donators are expected to represent the condition of Pieces honestly, while Collectors are encouraged to respect the process by only taking what is needed and providing feedback when possible. Occasional disputes or misunderstandings are resolved through conversation, reinforcing the collaborative spirit that underpins successful secondhand exchanges.

Through these ongoing activities, the domain supports not only the circulation of goods but also the cultivation of sustainability, mutual aid, and social connection. The exchange of clothing and accessories in Puerto Rico is thus a living narrative—one shaped by economic hardship, environmental necessity, and the enduring will of its people to support one another through challenging times. This narrative frames the motivation for structured, equitable, and transparent approaches to secondhand exchange, ensuring that all members of the community can access the resources they need with dignity and trust.

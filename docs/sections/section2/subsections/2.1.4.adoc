=== *2.1.4 Domain Narrative*

In Puerto Rico, the flow of clothing and accessories between individuals and families is shaped by pressing social, economic, and environmental realities. Each year, hundreds of millions of pounds of garments and textiles are discarded, adding to the nation’s mounting waste crisis and overwhelming local landfills. Despite the recyclability of most textiles, the majority end up as landfill waste — a reflection of both limited recycling infrastructure and a culture still transitioning toward sustainability. At the same time, clothing represents a basic need, one that is often out of reach for families facing high rates of poverty and for individuals experiencing homelessness. Within this context, the circulation of pre-owned items is not a marginal activity, but a vital process that supports daily life, education, dignity, and well-being.

The domain of secondhand clothing exchange involves a variety of actors and informal practices. Sellers — individuals or families with surplus or outgrown clothing — choose to make these items available for others, motivated by a mix of practicality, sustainability, and community-mindedness. Before posting, a seller may inspect each garment for cleanliness and condition, annotating the listing with information about size, wear, or visible defects. The act of publishing a listing marks the point at which the garment enters public visibility within the discovery space, allowing others to view and express interest.

Buyers — those seeking clothing and accessories — browse these visible listings through ad-hoc online channels or digital platforms. A buyer may be a student whose family cannot afford frequent purchases, a parent searching for affordable uniforms, or a community member simply aiming to reduce waste by reusing what already exists. When evaluating listings, buyers typically consider both the stated condition and the suitability of the garment. Interactions are often personal and conversational: buyers may send a message asking about fit or defects, while sellers provide reassurance through photos or clarifications. Once both parties agree, they coordinate to meet in person — completing the exchange directly and outside any digital system.

These exchanges are embedded in a broader cycle of reuse and redistribution. Garments often pass through multiple owners, with each transition adding to the item’s social history. Some pieces re-enter circulation when outgrown, while others are repaired or repurposed to extend their lifespan. The community sustains informal norms of honesty and trust: sellers are expected to represent item condition accurately, while buyers are encouraged to respect agreed meeting times and terms. Occasional misunderstandings — such as no-shows or misrepresented condition — are resolved through communication or social feedback, reinforcing a shared ethic of fairness.

Through these ongoing practices, the domain fosters sustainability, mutual aid, and local connection. The circulation of clothing and accessories in Puerto Rico is thus a living narrative — one shaped by economic hardship, environmental necessity, and the collective will of its people to reduce waste and support one another. This narrative frames the motivation for structured, transparent, and community-driven listing systems, enabling participants to access what they need with dignity and trust while maintaining the informal, person-to-person character that defines this exchange culture.

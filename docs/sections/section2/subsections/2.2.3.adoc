=== *2.2.3 — Domain Requirements*

[requirements]

[[REQ-DR1]]
*DR1:* The system **must** classify every listing under exactly one primary category.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.1>>, <<FEATURE-1.2>>, <<FEATURE-1.3>>, <<FEATURE-2.1>>, <<FEATURE-2.2>>, <<FEATURE-3.4>>, <<FEATURE-4.1>>, <<FEATURE-4.2>>, <<FEATURE-4.3>>, <<FEATURE-6.2>>

[[REQ-DR2]]
*DR2:* Categories **may** contain hierarchical subcategories to improve browsing and discovery.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.1>>

[[REQ-DR3]]
*DR3:* The system **must distinguish** between **Resale** and **Free/Donation** listings as separate domain concepts.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.2>>, <<FEATURE-3.1>>, <<FEATURE-3.2>>, <<FEATURE-3.3>>, <<FEATURE-4.4>>, <<FEATURE-5.1>>, <<FEATURE-5.2>>, <<FEATURE-6.1>>, <<FEATURE-6.2>>

==== *Justification: Why Donation Is Not Equivalent to a Zero-Price Sale*

Although both resale and donation result in a transfer of a garment, they represent **different domain phenomena** with distinct motivations, norms, and semantic meanings. Treating donation as “a sale with price = 0” would remove important conceptual differences observed in the domain.

*Behavioral Motivation*  
- **Resale**: economically motivated; seller seeks to recover value.  
- **Donation**: altruistic; donor intends to help others, reduce waste, or support sustainability efforts.  

*Community Norms*  
Donation is associated with mutual aid and generosity in the UPRM community. A price of zero does not convey this norm.

*Visibility & Discovery*  
Users explicitly search for **“free”** items. Donation must therefore remain a first-class filter option.

*Trust & Safety*  
Donation often involves fewer expectations (no negotiation, reduced pressure).  
Resale more strongly depends on accuracy, fairness, and condition disclosure.

*Lifecycle Semantics*  
Donation listings follow a different lifecycle aligned with sustainability initiatives and circular-economy metrics.

*Institutional Relevance*  
Thrift partners, clothing drives, and sustainability officers track donation flows distinctly. Modeling donation explicitly enables meaningful reporting and collaboration.

**Conclusion:**  
Donation must remain a **separate domain category**, not a numeric corner case, to preserve domain fidelity and support community-driven behaviors.

[[REQ-DR4]]
*DR4:* The system shall **support** (not enforce) item-to-category compatibility by providing guidance, suggestions, and warnings during listing creation.

This may include:
- category suggestions based on title, description, or metadata  
- highlighting frequently used categories for similar items  
- warnings for unusual category choices  
- optional LLM or image-recognition–based suggestions  

This requirement does **not** authorize enforcement. Users retain autonomy over category selection.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.1>>, <<FEATURE-4.1>>

[[REQ-DR5]]
*DR5:* The system **must support category evolution**, allowing categories to be updated, merged, or extended as the domain grows.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-4.3>>

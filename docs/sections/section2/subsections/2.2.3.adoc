=== *2.2.3 Domain Requirements*

[requirements]

[[REQ-DR1]]
*DR1:* The system must classify every listing under exactly one primary category.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.1>>, <<FEATURE-1.2>>, <<FEATURE-1.3>>, <<FEATURE-2.1>>, <<FEATURE-2.2>>, <<FEATURE-3.4>>, <<FEATURE-4.1>>, <<FEATURE-4.2>>, <<FEATURE-4.3>>, <<FEATURE-6.2>>

[[REQ-DR2]]
*DR2:* Categories may have hierarchical subcategories.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.1>>

[[REQ-DR3]]
*DR3:* The system must distinguish between **Resale** and **Free/Donation** listings.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.2>>, <<FEATURE-3.1>>, <<FEATURE-3.2>>, <<FEATURE-3.3>>, <<FEATURE-4.4>>, <<FEATURE-5.1>>, <<FEATURE-5.2>>, <<FEATURE-6.1>>, <<FEATURE-6.2>>


==== *Justification: Why Donation Is Not Equivalent to a Zero-Price Sale*

While both resale and donation result in a transfer of an item, they represent **fundamentally different domain phenomena** that must remain distinct in the model. Treating donation as simply “a sale at price = 0” erases critical behavioral, motivational, and social differences observed in the field:

*Behavioral Motivation*  
- **Resale** is economically motivated: sellers intend to recover value.  
- **Donation** is altruistic: donors intend to help others, reduce waste, or give items a second life.  
These intentions affect how users browse, filter, and evaluate listings.

*Community Norms*  
In observed platforms and local UPRM reuse culture, donation is framed as part of **mutual aid** and community support. A zero-price sale does not communicate the same norm of generosity or accessibility.

*Visibility & Discovery Differences*  
Users frequently search *only* for free items—especially students with financial constraints.  
Treating donation as a sale at price 0 would require special-case logic to recreate a distinction that exists naturally in the domain.

*Trust & Safety Implications*  
Donation interactions often carry lighter expectations:  
- no negotiation  
- no price comparison  
- less pressure to “justify” quality  
Resale carries transactional expectations around condition, fairness, and accuracy.

*Lifecycle & Data Semantics*  
Donation signals a **different lifecycle path**, aligning with sustainability and circular-economy practices.  
Platforms and institutions (e.g., sustainability coordinators, thrift partners) often track donation volumes separately from resale activity.

*Legal & Institutional Context*  
Some campus programs, community drives, or thrift partners only accept donation flows—not resales.  
Modeling donation explicitly allows these stakeholders (e.g., Fernando, Isidra, Dr. Rivera) to interpret the platform’s impact correctly.

For these reasons, the system must treat donation as its own domain concept rather than encoding it as a numeric edge case. This preserves clear intent, aligns with community expectations, and supports accurate categorization, filtering, reporting, and future integrations with sustainability efforts.

[[REQ-DR4]]
*DR4:* The system shall *support* item-to-category compatibility by helping users select an appropriate category for their listing. The system should provide suggestions or guidance, but shall not attempt to strictly enforce correctness.

To assist users, the system may:
- suggest likely categories based on the title, description, or user-selected attributes  
- highlight common category choices for similar items  
- warn when a category seems unusual (e.g., “Did you mean: Footwear?”)  
- optionally use image recognition or LLM-assisted suggestions to improve accuracy

This requirement does **not** imply strict enforcement or prevention of mismatches.  
Its purpose is to reduce accidental misclassification while respecting user autonomy.

*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-1.1>>, <<FEATURE-4.1>>

[[REQ-DR5]]
*DR5:* The system must support category evolution.  
*Supported by:* <<FEATURE-4.3>>

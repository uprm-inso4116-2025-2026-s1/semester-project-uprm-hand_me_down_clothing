=== *2.2.3 Domain Requirements*

The system shall manage listings according to the inherent properties of categories, items, and taxonomy structure in the domain of classified and donation listings.


[requirements]
* DR1: The system must classify every listing under exactly one primary category, ensuring consistent organization and discoverability across the taxonomy.
* DR2: The system must allow categories to have hierarchical subcategories, reflecting the domain property of multi-level classification used in established marketplaces.
* DR3: The system must distinguish between **Sell** and **Donate** listing taxonomies, preserving the domain difference in category depth and item grouping.
* DR4: The system shall provide means to enforce item-to-category compatibility, ensuring that each listing aligns with an appropriate category (e.g., vehicles cannot be placed under clothing).
* DR5: The system must support category evolution, allowing the taxonomy to incorporate new categories or subcategories without invalidating existing listings.

Each of these requirements directly ties to observed domain properties:  
- DR1 reflects the necessity of a single, authoritative classification per item.  
- DR2 enforces hierarchical structures present in all reference taxonomies.  
- DR3 respects the distinction between selling and donating, observed in multiple platforms.  
- DR4 ensures semantic alignment between items and categories, preventing domain violations.  
- DR5 supports the domain need for scalability and adaptability as marketplaces evolve.

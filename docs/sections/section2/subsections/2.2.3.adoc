=== *2.2.3 Domain Requirements*

The system shall manage clothing listings according to the inherent properties of categories, items, and taxonomy structures observed in [.changed]#local resale and donation discovery platforms.#  
[.added]#It must allow users to browse, publish, and filter listings efficiently without facilitating in-platform payments or transactions.#

[requirements]
* DR1: The system must classify every listing under exactly one primary category [.changed]#(e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories) to ensure consistent organization and discoverability across the taxonomy.#
* DR2: The system must allow categories to have hierarchical subcategories, reflecting [.changed]#how real-world resale and reuse spaces organize clothing by type, gender, or size.#
* DR3: The system must distinguish between [.changed]#**Resale** and **Free/Donation** listings, preserving the domain difference in motivation and visibility while keeping both accessible through a unified discovery interface.#
* DR4: The system shall provide means to enforce item-to-category compatibility, ensuring that each listing aligns with an appropriate [.added]#clothing# category [.changed]#(e.g., shirts cannot be placed under footwear).#
* DR5: The system must support category evolution, allowing the taxonomy to incorporate new categories or subcategories [.added]#(e.g., uniforms, vintage)# without invalidating existing listings.

Each of these requirements directly ties to observed domain properties:  
- **DR1** reflects the necessity of a single, authoritative classification per item for consistent search results.  
- **DR2** enforces hierarchical organization used in established discovery platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist.  
- **DR3** maintains the conceptual distinction between resale and giveaway behavior while allowing both to coexist.  
- **DR4** ensures semantic alignment between items and categories, avoiding misclassified listings.  
- **DR5** enables adaptability and scalability as the listing ecosystem evolves and new categories emerge.

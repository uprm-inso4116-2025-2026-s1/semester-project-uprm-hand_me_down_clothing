=== *2.2.1 Epics, Features, and User Stories*

=== *Epics*

Epics are a higher-level overview of goals that are large enough in scope that they can be broken down into multiple sprints. They provide direction and group related work together.

*Buyer Epics*

. Listing Discovery  
.. As a buyer, I want to search for listings by category, filters, and keywords, so that I can quickly find clothing items that meet my needs.  

. Saved Listings  
.. As a buyer, I want to bookmark listings I am interested in, so that I can revisit them later when deciding whether to contact the seller.  

. Trust and Transparency  
.. As a buyer, I want to view detailed seller profiles and leave reviews after exchanges, so that I can make informed and confident decisions about future interactions.  

*Seller Epics*

. Listing Management  
.. As a seller, I want to create, edit, and close listings with detailed information, so that I can effectively manage the items I am offering for reuse or resale.  

. Interest Notifications  
.. As a seller, I want to receive notifications when someone shows interest in my item, so that I can promptly respond and arrange the exchange offline.  

. Seller Profile and Trust  
.. As a seller, I want to maintain a profile with personal and location details, so that I can establish credibility and attract buyers interested in my listings.

=== *2.2.1 Epics, Features, and User Stories*

=== *Epics*

Epics are a higher-level overview of goals that are large enough in scope that they can be broken down into multiple sprints. They provide direction and group related work together.

*Buyer Epics*

. Product Search
.. As a buyer, I want to search for items by category, filters, and keywords, so that I can quickly find products that meet my needs.

. Saved Listings
.. As a buyer, I want to save or bookmark items I am interested in, so that I can revisit them later when deciding whether to contact the seller.

. Trust and Transparency
.. As a buyer, I want to access detailed seller information and provide feedback through reviews, so that I can make informed and confident decisions.

*Seller Epics*

. Listing Management
.. As a seller, I want to create, edit, and delete listings with many details, so that I can effectively manage the items I am offering.

. Contact Notifications
.. As a seller, I want to receive notifications when someone shows interest in my item, so that I can promptly respond and arrange the exchange offline.

. Seller Profile and Trust
.. As a seller, I want to build a profile with personal and location details, so that I can establish trust with buyers and encourage engagement with my listings.

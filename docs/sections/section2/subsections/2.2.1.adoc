=== *2.2.1 Epics, Features, and User Stories*

Epics describe high-level goals that span multiple sprints and require several coordinated features.  
Features refine epics into concrete functionality.  
User stories express these features from the perspective of domain stakeholders.

Traceability uses AsciiDoc anchors to link:
EPIC → FEATURE → REQUIREMENT  
and back REQUIREMENT → FEATURE → EPIC

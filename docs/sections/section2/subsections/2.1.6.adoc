=== *2.1.6 - Function Signatures*

==== Objective
Define domain-level function signatures that describe how actions are carried out, including inputs,
outputs, and possible changes in the domain.

==== Description
Function signatures are formal specifications of functions or actions that define:

- *The name of the function*: The action being performed.  
- *The input parameters*: The information required by the action.  
- *Output*: Type of data the function produces.  
- *State changes*: How the action affects the domain.

The general format of a function signature is:

- FunctionName: Input1 >< Input2 >< ... -> OutputType

This expresses the action's name, its input parameters with their types, the output type it produces,
and any state changes in the domain.

Function signatures do not describe how the function is implemented. Instead, they focus on the
relationship between inputs, outputs, and possible state changes.

==== Examples

publishListing : Piece >< Seller >< Locale -> ListingPublished +  
A Seller publishes a Piece in a given Locale, producing a ListingPublished event.

expressInterest : Listing >< Buyer -> InterestExpressed +  
A Buyer expresses interest in a specific Listing, producing an InterestExpressed event that signals contact between Buyer and Seller.

rate : Piece >< ConditionRating -> ConditionRating +  
A Piece receives a ConditionRating, producing or updating the ConditionRating attribute.

review : Seller >< Buyer >< Review -> ReviewSubmitted +  
A review is submitted by a Buyer or Seller after an offline exchange, creating a ReviewSubmitted event associated with the interaction.

closeListing : Listing >< Seller -> ListingClosed +  
A Seller closes a Listing after the offline exchange or withdrawal, producing a ListingClosed event and removing the item from visibility.

categorize : Piece >< Type -> Piece +  
A Piece is assigned a Type, returning the updated Piece.

discard : Piece -> Void +  
Removes a Piece from active circulation, marking it as no longer available.

==== Example Scenario: From Listing to Offline Exchange
1. Seller publishes a listing using `publishListing(Piece, Seller, Locale)` → produces `ListingPublished`.  
2. Buyer browses available items and finds one of interest.  
3. Buyer clicks “Contact Seller,” triggering `expressInterest(Listing, Buyer)` → produces `InterestExpressed`.  
4. Both users coordinate offline to exchange the item.  
5. Seller closes the listing via `closeListing(Listing, Seller)` → produces `ListingClosed`.  
6. Buyer leaves a review using `review(Seller, Buyer, Review)` → produces `ReviewSubmitted`.

=== *2.1.6 - Function Signatures*

==== Objective
Define domain-level function signatures that describe how actions are carried out, including inputs,
outputs, and possible changes in the domain.

==== Description
Function signatures are formal specifications of functions or actions that define:

- *The name of the function*: The action being performed.
- *The input parameters*: The information required by the action.
- *Output*: Type of data the function produces.
- *State changes*: How the action affects the domain.

The general format of a function signature is:

- FunctionName: Input1 >< Input2 >< ... -> OutputType

This expresses the action's name, its input parameters with their types, the output type it produces
and any state changes in the domain.

Function signatures do not describe how the function is implemented. Instead, they focus on the
relationship between inputs, outputs, and possible state changes.

==== Examples

donate : Piece >< Donator >< Locale -> Donation,
A Donator provides a Piece in a given Locale, producing a Donation event.

collect : Piece >< Collector -> Collection +
A Collector claims a Piece, producing a Collection event.

rate : Piece >< ConditionRating -> ConditionRating +
A Piece receives a ConditionRating, producing or updating the ConditionRating.

review : Collection >< Review -> Review +
A review is attached to a completed collection.

transaction : Piece >< Collector >< Locale -> Review >< (Option Ignore) +
A transaction requires a Piece (the item being transacted), Collector (the entity who initiates the
transaction), and the locale (the locale in which the transaction is taking place) in order to
produce a Review. If the transaction were to fail, produces no outcome (Ignore). A transfer or transaction describes the handoff process, not a platform transaction.

categorize : Piece >< Type -> Piece +
A piece is assigned a type, returning the updated piece.

discard : Piece -> Void +
Removes a piece from active circulation.

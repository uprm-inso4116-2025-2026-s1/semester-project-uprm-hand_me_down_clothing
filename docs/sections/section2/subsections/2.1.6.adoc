=== *2.1.6 - Function Signatures*

==== Objective
Define domain-level function signatures that describe how actions are carried out, including inputs,
outputs, and possible changes in the domain.

==== Description

Function signatures specify how actors in the system interact through domain actions. They define the logical relationships between inputs, outputs, and resulting state changes: 

- *The name of the function*: The action being performed.  
- *The input parameters*: The information required by the action.  
- *Output*: Type of data the function produces.  
- *State changes*: How the action affects the domain.

The general format of a function signature is:

- FunctionName: Input1 >< Input2 >< ... -> OutputType
- **Description** – what the function does.
- **Preconditions** – what must be true or available for the function to execute.
- **Postconditions** - what becomes true afterwards.
- **Notes** - clarifications about scope, limits, or non-covered cases.

==== Examples

publishListing : Piece >< Seller >< Locale -> Either[ValidationError,ListingPublished]

Description::  
A Buyer signals interest in a Listing, creating a persistent Interest relationship between Buyer and Seller.

==== Example Scenario: From Listing to Offline Exchange
1. Seller publishes a listing using `publishListing(Piece, Seller, Locale)` → produces `ListingPublished`.  
2. Buyer browses available items and finds one of interest.  
3. Buyer triggers `expressInterest(Listing, Buyer)` → produces `InterestExpressed`.  
4. Both users coordinate offline to exchange the item.  
5. Seller closes the listing via `closeListing(Listing, Seller)` → produces `ListingClosed`.  
6. Buyer leaves a review using `review(Seller, Buyer, Review)` → produces `ReviewSubmitted`.

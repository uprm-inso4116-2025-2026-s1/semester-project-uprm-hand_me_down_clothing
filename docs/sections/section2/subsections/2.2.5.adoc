=== *2.2.5 Machine Requirements*

==== Objective
The web server must support reliable and efficient operation of a React + JavaScript clothing discovery platform, enabling users to create, browse, filter, and save listings. Requirements are defined in measurable, testable terms to ensure responsiveness, reliability, and scalability. The platform does not handle payments, carts, or checkout operations; all exchanges between buyers and sellers occur offline after contact through the system.

To avoid ambiguity, terms such as *simultaneous users*, *average load*, *peak load*, and *uptime window* are defined in advance.  
(See the “Clarifications,” “Load Definitions,” and “User Mix Scenarios” sections below for detailed breakdowns.)

==== Requirements

*Performance*
- The system shall return **search results within 2 seconds on average**, where “average” refers to the mean response time over a **5-minute rolling window** during normal operating hours.  
- The system shall maintain a maximum response time of **4 seconds** under peak load, defined as **150 concurrent active users** performing real-time actions (see Clarifications <<MR-Clarifications>>).  
- The system shall support **200 simultaneous browsing users**, where “simultaneous” refers to users performing actions within the same **10-second activity window** (e.g., searching, filtering, saving listings, viewing details).  
- Listing creation and updates (e.g., uploading images, editing descriptions, updating status) shall complete within **3 seconds on average**, excluding client-side image compression delays.

*Reliability*
- The web server shall maintain an uptime of **99.7% measured monthly**, allowing no more than **2.1 hours** of unscheduled downtime **per calendar month**.  
- Core operations — creating, editing, saving, and closing listings — must be processed reliably, with **no more than 0.1% of requests** failing due to server errors.  
- Scheduled maintenance shall be limited to **3 hours per month**, with announcements given at least **48 hours in advance**.

*Scalability*
- The system shall scale to support **500 concurrent users** performing mixed actions (browsing, searching, creating listings, saving favorites, sending messages) while maintaining average response times ≤ **3.5 seconds**.  
- The system shall handle a database of up to **50,000 active listings** without significant degradation (response time increase ≤ **20%** compared to baseline).  
- The system shall support both **vertical scaling** (increasing server resources) and **horizontal scaling** (adding more servers or instances) without major architectural changes.

==== Clarifications [[MR-Clarifications]]
- “Peak load” is defined as **≥ 150 concurrent active users** within a **10-second action window**, with at least **10% performing listing creation or updates**.  
- “Average load” refers to typical daytime usage of **200 concurrent users**, where actions occur within a **1-minute window**.  
- “Minimal outages” means **≤ 2.1 hours of unplanned downtime per month**.  
- “Acceptable performance” means **≤ 3.5 seconds response time for 95% of requests** measured over a **rolling daily interval**.  
- Terms are defined before more detailed breakdowns in the *Load Definitions* section (see below).

==== Areas for Refinement
- Stress tolerance for **extreme traffic spikes** (≥ 1000 users during semester openings or large donation drives) remains under evaluation.  
- Performance on **mobile devices under weak network conditions** requires additional benchmarking.  
- Further testing is required for **concurrent image upload** operations and cache performance during peak activity.

==== Justification
The clothing discovery platform requires fast, consistent responses to maintain usability and trust. Setting explicit definitions for “simultaneous,” “average,” “peak,” and “uptime windows” ensures the requirements are measurable and testable. These benchmarks align with lightweight listing platforms similar to Facebook Marketplace or OfferUp and support predictable behavior during high-demand periods such as semester starts or community donation events.

==== Load Definitions
Refined load definitions include:
- *Peak Concurrent Users*: 500 users performing actions within the same **10-second window**.  
- *Average Concurrent Users*: 200 users active within a **1-minute** usage window.  
- *Light Load*: < 80 active users interacting within a **1-minute window**.

==== User Mix Scenarios
1. *Scenario 1: Browsing Listings*  
   - 60% of users are browsing listings.  
   - Actions: Filtering, searching, viewing item details.

2. *Scenario 2: Creating Listings*  
   - 20% of users are creating new listings.  
   - Actions: Uploading photos, entering item details, submitting listings.

3. *Scenario 3: Messaging*  
   - 15% of users are messaging sellers or buyers.  
   - Actions: Sending and receiving messages.

4. *Scenario 4: Administrative Actions*  
   - 5% of users are performing administrative tasks.  
   - Actions: Moderating listings, resolving disputes.

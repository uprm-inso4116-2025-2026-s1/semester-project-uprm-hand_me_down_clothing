=== *2.2.4 Interface Requirements*

==== Objective
Define how users interact with the system through visible UI elements, controls, states, and feedback. These *Interface Requirements* specify the behavior of forms, buttons, validation, navigation, and visibility rules. The platform facilitates listing and discovery but does not process payments or host transactions; all exchanges occur directly between buyers and sellers outside the system.

==== Interface Requirements

*Create Listing Form*
- The authenticated user is implicitly the seller; **no seller field is displayed**.  
- Required fields: **Title**, **at least one Image**, and **Category**. Optional fields: **Price** (if absent, listing is marked **Free**), **Description**, **Condition**, and **Size**.  
- When selecting a **Category**, the system may show suggested categories based on the item’s title, description, or images. These suggestions help reduce misclassification but do **not** restrict the user’s choice.  
- The **Publish** button is **disabled** until all required fields are valid.  
- On submit with missing or invalid fields, show **inline errors**; **focus moves** to the first invalid field.  
- On success, navigate to the **Listing Details** page and show a **toast**: “Listing published.”


*Listing Details (Seller View)*
- Shows editable fields (Title, Description, Images, Price, Condition) while **Status = Active**.  
- Includes a **Status** dropdown with transitions: **Active → Reserved → Closed** (no skipping).  
- When **Status = Closed**, all edit controls are **disabled**, and a **‘Closed’ badge** is displayed.  
- Displays **Contact Requests** received for that listing, sorted by most recent.  

*Browse & Search (Buyer View)*
- Buyers can **search by keyword** and **filter by Category, Condition, Size, and Price/Free marker**.  
- Sorting options include **Newest first**, **Lowest price**, and **Condition rating**.  
- Each listing card shows **Title, Thumbnail, Price/Free marker, Condition, and Seller rating (if available)**.  
- Clicking a card opens **Listing Details**, where the **Contact Seller** button is visible if the viewer is not the owner.

*Saved Listings (Buyer View)*
- Buyers can **Save/Unsave** a listing from both the card and details views.  
- Saved items persist across sessions and appear in the **Saved Listings** section under the user menu.  
- Saved icons visually change state (e.g., outlined vs. filled heart).  

*Contact Seller / Messaging*
- **Contact Seller** opens a message composer prefilled with the listing title.  
- On send, show confirmation (“Message sent”) and add it to **Message Threads**.  
- Seller receives a **notification badge** in the header or inbox.  
- Messages are displayed chronologically, grouped by listing.  

*Profile & Reviews*
- Sellers and buyers each have a **profile page** displaying their listings, ratings, and reviews.  
- Users can **edit their own profile** (profile picture, bio, location).  
- Reviews are **read-only** for the profile owner but can be submitted by others after an offline exchange.  
- The **average rating** and total reviews are displayed prominently at the top of the profile.

*Accessibility & Feedback*
- All interactive elements are **keyboard-accessible** (Tab/Shift+Tab) with visible **focus outlines**.  
- Inline validation messages are **ARIA-live announced** to screen readers.  
- Toasts and banners are **non-blocking** and dismissible via keyboard.  
- Forms include descriptive labels and placeholder text for clarity.

==== Examples
1. **Create Listing**: A seller opens the *Create Listing* form. Title is empty and there are no images, so **Publish** is disabled. The user enters a title, selects a category, and uploads a photo. **Publish** becomes active. On submit, a success toast appears and the app redirects to the Listing Details page.  
2. **Reserve Then Close**: A seller opens their Listing (Status = Active), selects **Reserved** from the dropdown. After completing the exchange offline, they select **Closed**, disabling all edit controls.  
3. **Contact Seller**: A buyer opens a listing and clicks **Contact Seller**, writes a message, and sends it. A confirmation appears, and the seller’s header shows a **1** notification badge.

==== Relation to Domain Requirements
- Domain Requirements define what must exist (e.g., Listing entity, User, Saved association).  
- Interface Requirements define how users **create, view, modify, and interact** with those entities through UI components.  
- Each interface rule directly supports a domain rule by providing a visible, testable interaction.  

==== Justification
This section ensures that UI behaviors are intuitive, consistent, and verifiable. It separates internal representation (domain) from what users experience, providing a clear mapping between actions and visible states. These behaviors reinforce trust and usability while aligning with accessibility and real-world discovery practices.

==== Testing Plan
- Test each form and button for proper enable/disable states and validation.  
- Confirm that “Publish” and “Close” actions trigger correct navigation and feedback messages.  
- Verify that saved listings persist across sessions.  
- Ensure that editing is disabled once a listing is closed.  
- Check accessibility by tab-navigating forms and validating screen reader output.  
- Confirm that notifications appear when a buyer sends a contact message.

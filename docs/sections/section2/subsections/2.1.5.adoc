==== Listing and Discovery
[.added]#*Entity*::#  
[.added]#A **Listing** represents an item made visible by a seller for reuse or resale. It includes attributes such as title, description, category, condition, and images.#

[.removed]#All descriptions are domain-oriented and independent of any future system.#

[.added]#*Associated Actions*::#  
- [.added]#Publishing a listing with sufficient information (title, category, photos).#  
- [.added]#Editing details (price marker, condition, description).#  
- [.added]#Deactivating or closing a listing once the item is no longer available.#

===== [.removed]#Listing and Discovery of Clothing#
[.removed]#*Event*::#  
[.removed]#The instant a new listing has just been published, making a garment visible to potential buyers. This marks the start of its discovery phase in the informal exchange ecosystem.#

[.removed]#*Action*::#  
[.removed]#Steps such as photographing the garment, writing a short caption, setting a suggested price (optional), and posting the item for others to see. Each is purposeful and can succeed or fail (e.g., insufficient visibility, missing photos).#

[.added]#*Events*::#  
- [.added]#**Listing Published** — occurs when a seller makes an item visible to the public.#  
- [.added]#**Listing Updated** — occurs when a listing’s information has just been modified.#  
- [.added]#**Listing Closed** — occurs when the seller marks the listing as reserved or removed.#

*Behavior*::
[.removed]#The broader social practice of making items discoverable within community networks. It involves browsing existing listings, publishing new ones, refreshing or updating posts, and sharing links in messaging groups. This behaviour sustains circulation and visibility of reusable clothing.#

===== [.removed]#Disclosure of Item Condition#
[.removed]#*Event*::#  
[.removed]#A seller has just provided evidence about a garment’s state — e.g., sending a tag photo or mentioning a stain. The recipient gains new knowledge that may influence their decision.#

[.added]#The continuous cycle in which sellers create, update, and close listings to maintain an accurate catalog of available items.#

[.removed]#*Action*::#  
[.removed]#Taking photographs of the size tag or fabric, writing short notes about wear or washing, mentioning that an article is “lightly used” or “like new,” or warning of a missing button.#

[.removed]#*Behavior*::#  
[.removed]#An established norm of transparency in which participants consistently present information about cleanliness, durability, or flaws. By embedding honesty into exchanges, this behaviour fosters trust and helps avoid disputes over quality.#

==== [.added]#Searching and Filtering#
[.added]#*Entity*::#  
[.added]#A **Search Session** represents a buyer’s activity of exploring available listings through keywords, filters, and sorting criteria.#

===== [.removed]#Pricing and Valuation#
[.removed]#*Event*::#  
[.removed]#A suggested price has just been indicated, accepted, or adjusted for a garment.#

[.added]#*Associated Actions*::#  
- [.added]#Browsing listings by category or keyword.#  
- [.added]#Applying filters (e.g., size, price, condition).#  
- [.added]#Viewing item details.#

[.removed]#*Action*::#  
[.removed]#Comparing a proposed amount with informal references, adjusting for size or condition, or confirming that an item will be free rather than priced. Prices are symbolic and serve as indicators only; any monetary exchange happens directly between participants outside the platform.#

[.added]#*Events*::#  
- [.added]#**Search Performed** — occurs when a buyer initiates a search or filter operation.#  
- [.added]#**Result Viewed** — occurs when a buyer opens a specific listing.#

[.removed]#*Event*::#  
[.removed]#A household member has just set aside garments that no longer fit or are not in active use.#

[.removed]#*Action*::#  
[.removed]#Reviewing wardrobes, classifying items as “keep,” “give away,” or “maybe later,” placing them in bags or boxes, and storing them out of daily reach.#

[.removed]#*Behavior*::#  
[.removed]#The tendency for unused clothing to accumulate in homes. Owners postpone decisions about destination, creating an intermediate state between active use and disposal. This behaviour feeds both resale and reuse opportunities and, if left too long, textile waste.#

[.removed]#*Event*::#  
[.removed]#Two participants have just arrived at a chosen place to finalise an exchange.#

- [.added]#Reporting misleading or inaccurate listings.#

[.removed]#A buyer has just sent a message or inquiry expressing interest in a listed garment.#

[.removed]#*Action*::#

- [.added]#Inspecting the garment and finalizing the exchange offline.#  
- [.added]#Marking the listing as closed afterward.#

[.removed]#*Action*::#  
[.removed]#Seller toggles the status to “Closed,” adds an optional note (“Given away,” “Sold,” “No longer available”), or removes the post from visibility.#

[.added]#A **Piece** of clothing progresses through various life stages: active use, dormant storage, listing, exchange, and eventual disposal.#

[.removed]#Choosing clear, well-lit photos; greeting bilingually (Spanish/English); mentioning mutual contacts or personal references to confirm credibility.#

[.added]#*Associated Actions*::#  
- [.added]#Setting aside unused items (creating dormant stock).#  
- [.added]#Deciding whether to relist, donate, or discard.#  
- [.added]#Recycling or repurposing worn garments.#

[.removed]#*Behavior*::#  
[.removed]#The underlying social effort to manage uncertainty in face-to-face exchanges. By scanning cues of reliability, people decide whether to meet and complete a handoff. Trust-building behaviours make the informal market viable despite the lack of formal guarantees.#

[.removed]#Interest in a category of garment (e.g., uniforms, sweaters, raincoats) has just increased due to academic or weather cycles.#

[.added]#*Behavior*::#  
[.added]#A long-term lifecycle pattern connecting reuse and sustainability efforts within the community.#

[.removed]#*Action*::# 
[.removed]#Sorting and preparing clothes needed for the coming semester, advertising jackets before the rainy season, or searching for graduation attire.#

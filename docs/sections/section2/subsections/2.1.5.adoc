=== *2.1.5 Events, Actions, and Behaviors*
:location: Mayagüez, Puerto Rico (UPRM touchpoint)
:period: 2025

This section presents the main events, actions, and behaviors observed in the environment of informal clothing exchanges around the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. They were derived from the material collected in *2.1.1 – Domain Rough Sketch* and organised to separate:

* **Events** – instantaneous occurrences (“has just …”),  
* **Actions** – individual, intentional steps, and  
* **Behaviors** – extended patterns composed of multiple actions.

All descriptions are domain-oriented and independent of any future system.

===== Listing and Discovery of Clothing
*Event*::  
The instant a new listing has just been published, making a garment visible to potential buyers. This marks the start of its discovery phase in the informal exchange ecosystem.

*Action*::  
Steps such as photographing the garment, writing a short caption, setting a suggested price (optional), and posting the item for others to see. Each is purposeful and can succeed or fail (e.g., insufficient visibility, missing photos).

*Behavior*::  
The broader social practice of making items discoverable within community networks. It involves browsing existing listings, publishing new ones, refreshing or updating posts, and sharing links in messaging groups. This behaviour sustains circulation and visibility of reusable clothing.

===== Disclosure of Item Condition
*Event*::  
A seller has just provided evidence about a garment’s state — e.g., sending a tag photo or mentioning a stain. The recipient gains new knowledge that may influence their decision.

*Action*::  
Taking photographs of the size tag or fabric, writing short notes about wear or washing, mentioning that an article is “lightly used” or “like new,” or warning of a missing button.

*Behavior*::  
An established norm of transparency in which participants consistently present information about cleanliness, durability, or flaws. By embedding honesty into exchanges, this behaviour fosters trust and helps avoid disputes over quality.

===== Pricing and Valuation
*Event*::  
A suggested price has just been indicated, accepted, or adjusted for a garment.

*Action*::  
Comparing a proposed amount with informal references, adjusting for size or condition, or confirming that an item will be free rather than priced. Prices are symbolic and serve as indicators only; any monetary exchange happens directly between participants outside the platform.

*Behavior*::  
A continuing process of social valuation. Participants rely on a tacit “student resale price band” (often eight to fifteen dollars) to anchor expectations while allowing flexibility for free exchanges or bundles.

===== Management of Dormant Stock
*Event*::  
A household member has just set aside garments that no longer fit or are not in active use.

*Action*::  
Reviewing wardrobes, classifying items as “keep,” “give away,” or “maybe later,” placing them in bags or boxes, and storing them out of daily reach.

*Behavior*::  
The tendency for unused clothing to accumulate in homes. Owners postpone decisions about destination, creating an intermediate state between active use and disposal. This behaviour feeds both resale and reuse opportunities and, if left too long, textile waste.

===== Arranging and Conducting Meetups
*Event*::  
Two participants have just arrived at a chosen place to finalise an exchange.

*Action*::  
Selecting a bench, lobby, or café corner as the site; confirming time via message; travelling to the location; greeting and checking the garment.

*Behavior*::  
A familiar choreography in which actors choose semi-public, convenient spots that reduce risks of theft or fraud while making hand-offs efficient. This behaviour reflects unwritten safety norms within the community.

===== Use of Ad-hoc Channels
*Event*::  
A new offer or request for clothing has just been posted or noticed in an online group.

*Action*::  
Opening a marketplace app, composing a caption, adding photos, scrolling through listings, or sending a direct message to express interest.

*Behavior*::  
The regular reliance on lightly moderated platforms—Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp groups, Instagram stories—to discover, promote, and coordinate exchanges. This behaviour keeps circulation active and widens the reach beyond immediate acquaintances.

===== Expressing Interest and Communication
*Event*::  
A buyer has just sent a message or inquiry expressing interest in a listed garment.

*Action*::  
Clicking “Contact Seller,” asking about size, color, or price, or arranging a time and place to meet. Communication may occur in-app or through external messaging tools.

*Behavior*::  
An essential part of peer-to-peer discovery that turns visibility into connection. These behaviors form the bridge between digital discovery and offline exchange.

===== Closing a Listing
*Event*::  
A listing has just been marked as closed, either because the exchange occurred offline or the item is no longer available.

*Action*::  
Seller toggles the status to “Closed,” adds an optional note (“Given away,” “Sold,” “No longer available”), or removes the post from visibility.

*Behavior*::  
A responsible cleanup action that keeps listings accurate and maintains trust among participants by ensuring only available items remain visible.

===== Building Trust
*Event*::  
A participant has just received a reassuring sign, such as recognising a familiar name, seeing unedited pictures, or receiving a message in their preferred language.

*Action*::  
Choosing clear, well-lit photos; greeting bilingually (Spanish/English); mentioning mutual contacts or personal references to confirm credibility.

*Behavior*::  
The underlying social effort to manage uncertainty in face-to-face exchanges. By scanning cues of reliability, people decide whether to meet and complete a handoff. Trust-building behaviours make the informal market viable despite the lack of formal guarantees.

===== Responding to Seasonal Demand
*Event*::  
Interest in a category of garment (e.g., uniforms, sweaters, raincoats) has just increased due to academic or weather cycles.

*Action*::  
Sorting and preparing clothes needed for the coming semester, advertising jackets before the rainy season, or searching for graduation attire.

*Behavior*::  
A cyclical pattern in which attention to certain garments rises and falls. Back-to-school weeks, semester openings, and cooler months create pulses of activity, stimulating listing and discovery at predictable times.

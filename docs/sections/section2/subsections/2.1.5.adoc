=== *2.1.5 — Events, Actions, and Behaviors*

This section contains only **events**, **actions**, and the **behaviors** they compose.  
Entities, repositories, or structural concepts appear elsewhere and are not repeated here.

---

==== Events
Domain **events** are instantaneous occurrences that record that something of significance has happened in the domain.

*Listing Published*::  
Occurs at the moment a seller makes an item publicly visible.

*Interest Expressed*::  
Occurs when a buyer signals interest in a listing.  
This marks the moment the *expression* of interest happens; the corresponding entity is handled elsewhere.

*Listing Updated*::  
Occurs when visible listing attributes (images, title, condition, category, etc.) are modified.

*Listing Closed*::  
Occurs when a seller marks a listing as terminal (sold, donated, or retracted).

---

==== Actions
Domain **actions** are deliberate operations performed by actors that may trigger events.

*Publish Item*::  
A seller provides the information required to make an item visible.  
_Triggers:_ **Listing Published**

*Browse*::  
A buyer inspects available listings, optionally using filters.  
_Triggers:_ none; browsing is a pure query.

*Express Interest*::  
A buyer initiates contact or signals desire to acquire a listing.  
_Triggers:_ **Interest Expressed**

*Update Listing*::  
A seller modifies previously posted information.  
_Triggers:_ **Listing Updated**

*Close Listing*::  
A seller marks the listing as no longer available after an exchange or a withdrawal.  
_Triggers:_ **Listing Closed**

==== Behaviors
A **behavior** is a recurring pattern consisting of a sequence of actions and the events they produce.  
Behaviors arise across many instances of the domain and capture the characteristic rhythm of interactions.

===== 1. Listing Lifecycle Behavior
A recurring pattern describing how an item becomes visible, may be refined, and eventually leaves active circulation.

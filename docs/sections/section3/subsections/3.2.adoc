=== *3.2 Validation and Verification*

Validation and verification ensure that the Hand Me Down platform meets stakeholder needs,
maintains internal consistency across modules, and satisfies measurable quality standards
defined in the requirements. These activities are carried out continuously and collaboratively
across all sub-teams—Documentation & Requirements, Authentication, Listings, Map/Search, and UI/UX—
to preserve traceability from stakeholder needs through implementation and testing.

==== Validation

*Domain and Requirements Validation*::  
Validation of terminology and requirements was performed iteratively through internal
documentation reviews. Each update to §§ 2.1 – 2.3 was examined to confirm that
domain concepts such as *Piece*, *Listing*, *Condition Disclosure Norm*, and *Listing Closed*
remained coherent and aligned with stakeholder needs (§ 1.2.2).  
All requirements now employ definitive “shall/must” statements instead of uncertain
language (“may,” “aims”) to ensure they are directly testable.  
No external stakeholder validation sessions have yet occurred; these will take place in later
milestones to confirm usability and trust cues with students and families.

*Scenario Walkthroughs*::  
Walkthroughs were conducted for the **publishing** process, tracing data flow from
form submission to Supabase storage. No inconsistencies were found.
Editing, closing, and saving workflows are planned for final-phase validation once their
implementations are complete.

*Category and Condition Refinement*::  
Internal validation led to refinement of the category taxonomy and condition-rating scales,
resolving ambiguities from the initial model. Terminology was standardized to
**Donated Piece** and **Sold Piece** to ensure semantic consistency across documentation and database layers.

*Search and Map Validation*::  
The Map & Search module was validated by cross-checking UI results against the actual
data stored in Supabase. Each search query correctly displayed only listings matching its
attributes, and filter walkthroughs confirmed accurate behavior for “Tops,” “Bottoms,” and “All.”  
Usability was validated through manual inspection: map markers are accurately pinned,
display complete popup information (name, address, hours), and maintain expected
cluster and static behaviors. Search relevance and marker accuracy confirm correct data
binding between UI and repository functions.

*Authentication Validation*::  
Supabase Auth integration was validated by confirming that users can **sign up, log in, and log out**
successfully without confusion. The authentication flow follows Supabase and OWASP
recommendations for secure web login. Manual tests were executed in Google Chrome,
Firefox, and Brave on desktop devices. Error messages were displayed properly when
login, signup, or logout failed. Mobile testing is scheduled for the next milestone.

*UI/UX Validation*::  
Informal validation was performed through manual walkthroughs and internal demos.
Team members and classmates interacted with the interface to identify confusing or redundant
elements and provided feedback on button labeling and visibility of listing-creation steps.
Adjustments were applied iteratively, improving label clarity and layout alignment.  
Accessibility was validated manually through color-contrast and tab-navigation checks.
Primary text and buttons met readability standards, and form elements followed a logical tab order.
Semantic HTML was verified for buttons and labels, while full ARIA labeling and automated
accessibility audits are planned for the next milestone.

*Planned Stakeholder Validation*::  
A short validation session with student volunteers will be scheduled before the final milestone
to evaluate clarity of interface terminology, filter usability, and trust indicators such as
condition labels and safety guidance.

==== Verification

*Traceability and Acceptance Criteria*::  
A preliminary *Need → Requirement → Test* mapping exists conceptually and will be formalized
in `/docs/tests/traceability.adoc` for milestone 3. Each requirement includes measurable
acceptance conditions:  
– Interface Requirements define button-state validation, inline error messaging, and toast feedback.  
– Machine Requirements specify response-time thresholds (≤ 2 s average; ≤ 4 s peak) and uptime ≥ 99.7 %.  
– Domain Requirements link directly to test cases verifying classification and visibility logic.

*Unit Testing*::  
Manual unit tests were completed for **publishListing()**, validating data verification,
database insertion, and frontend feedback. All manual tests passed successfully.
Additional automated unit tests for **closeListing()** and **editListing()** are scheduled for
the next milestone. Authentication unit tests validated correct sign-up, login, and logout
behavior, while error handling displayed expected feedback messages when failures occurred.

*Integration Testing*::  
End-to-end tests confirmed correct UI-to-database behavior: information entered in the
listing form propagates through backend validation and is stored in Supabase as expected.
Integration with Authentication (user ID linkage) will be completed in the final milestone.
The Search module’s repository functions
(`PieceRepository.getPieces()` and `filterPieces()`)
were validated indirectly through accurate data synchronization between Supabase
queries and the rendered results.  
Authentication privacy constraints were verified through **role-based access control**
using Supabase **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies implemented in issue #301.  
Interface behaviors—such as disabled Publish buttons until form validation passes,
visible toast messages, and navigation flow correctness—were manually verified against
the Interface Requirements. Visual consistency was confirmed across browsers.

*Load and Performance Testing*::  
Preliminary manual observations show average search responses in **≈ 1 second**
and listing creation times under **0.5 seconds**—both within the defined machine-requirement limits.
Formal automated load testing using **k6** will be added to simulate concurrent usage
(150 – 500 users) and confirm scalability benchmarks.
Authentication latency and API response times will also be measured in the next milestone.

*Data Validation and Security Checks*::  
Map-coordinate rendering logic filters out invalid or non-finite latitude/longitude
values, preventing off-map markers. All markers are non-draggable, ensuring location data
remains immutable in the UI.  
RLS policies in Supabase protect user records by restricting read/write access
based on authentication state and role.  
UI components were visually validated across major browsers (Chrome, Edge) to ensure
consistent layout, iconography, and branding defined in the global style guide.

*Continuous Verification*::  
A GitHub Actions workflow will execute linting and unit-test jobs on pull requests to
maintain consistent quality and prevent regressions once automated tests are in place.

==== Outcomes

– Documentation, domain model, and requirements were aligned and validated through internal review cycles.  
– Listing-publication backend passed all manual unit tests, achieving < 0.5 s creation time.  
– Search and map functionalities were validated against Supabase data, loading results in ≈ 1 s on average.  
– Map markers were verified for nine sample donation centers.  
– Authentication features (sign up, login, logout) were validated across major desktop browsers with secure RLS policies.  
– UI elements and flows passed internal usability and accessibility checks; no critical issues were reported.  
– Category and condition-rating systems were refined for accuracy and uniformity.  
– Traceability structure and automated CI testing are established for completion in the final milestone.

Together, these validation and verification activities confirm that the system
concepts are sound, the current implementation behaves as specified, and measurable
criteria are in place to ensure the platform remains reliable, scalable, and aligned with
stakeholder expectations as development continues.

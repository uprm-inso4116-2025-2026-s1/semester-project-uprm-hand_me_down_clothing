=== *3.2 Validation and Verification*

Validation and verification activities ensure that the Hand Me Down projectâ€™s 
deliverables meet the intended quality standards, align with stakeholder needs, 
and remain consistent with the domain description, requirements, and architecture. 
These activities are conducted as an ongoing, shared responsibility across all teams.

==== Validation

Validation activities focus on confirming that our understanding of the domain and 
requirements is accurate and complete, even before implementation:

* *Scenario Walkthroughs*:: Draft scenarios were created and reviewed internally 
  within the team to test whether our domain terminology, requirements, and workflows 
  are coherent. For example, walkthroughs of donation and resale flows helped 
  highlight whether our categorization and pricing assumptions were consistent.  
* *Requirement Exploration*:: At this stage, no external validation with students 
  or families has been performed. Instead, internal reviews are used to identify 
  potential gaps, such as safety practices for meetups or the way condition 
  disclosure norms are represented.

==== Verification

Verification ensures that system components behave as prescribed and that 
deliverables can be tested against measurable criteria:

* *Unit Testing*:: Individual components of the system will be tested using unit 
  tests to verify correctness in isolation. This includes authentication functions, 
  item listing logic, and condition rating updates.
* *Integration Testing*:: Selected flows (e.g., creating a listing, completing a 
  transaction) will be tested across multiple modules to ensure interactions 
  remain consistent.
* *Load Testing with k6*:: Performance and scalability will be evaluated using the 
  k6 framework. Initial load tests will target ~150 concurrent users, scaling up 
  to 500, to verify that response times remain within the defined machine 
  requirements.
* *Traceability Checks*:: Deliverables will be reviewed against the requirements 
  and terminology to ensure completeness and consistency. Each requirement will 
  be linked to validation and verification artifacts (test cases, scenarios).
* *Planned A/B Testing*:: As the UI/UX evolves, A/B testing will be used to validate 
  design hypotheses. Examples include testing filter placement in the item search 
  page, or checkout button positioning. Metrics such as time-to-action and user 
  satisfaction will guide design decisions.

==== Roles and Responsibilities

Validation and verification are a *shared responsibility* across the team.  
While individual sub-teams focus on different aspects (e.g., listings, 
authentication, documentation), every member contributes to writing, reviewing, 
and executing tests and walkthroughs. This ensures that quality is embedded 
throughout the project rather than isolated in a single role.

==== Outcomes

The combination of walkthroughs, scenario-based validation, unit and integration 
testing, load testing, and A/B experimentation provides a balanced approach:  

* *Validation* ensures that the concepts and requirements are correctly understood 
  and aligned with the domain.  
* *Verification* ensures that implementation artifacts conform to measurable 
  standards and deliver the expected performance.  

Together, these practices guarantee that the Hand Me Down project remains 
trustworthy, usable, and scalable in the context of secondhand exchanges.

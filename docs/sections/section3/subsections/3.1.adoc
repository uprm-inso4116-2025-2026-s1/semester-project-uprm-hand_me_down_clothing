==== *3.1 - Concept analysis*

=== Method
The domain rough sketch was reviewed to identify recurring ideas and terminology. Ambiguities were noted, compared, and resolved by introducing consistent abstractions. This ensures traceability from observations to domain-level concepts while avoiding system-to-be details.

=== Clothing Item
- *Observation*: Notes reference “clothing,” “garments,” and “items” in different contexts.  
- *Issue*: Terms overlap without clarity on whether they refer to a single piece or a category.  
- *Resolution*: Standardized as **Clothing Item**, representing any individual piece of apparel.  
- *Justification*: Provides a neutral, unambiguous unit of exchange within the domain.  
- *Concept*: `Clothing Item` (entity).

=== Donation vs. Recycling
- *Observation*: Actions include “donating clothes,” “claiming items,” and “recycling textiles.”  
- *Issue*: Donation and recycling are sometimes mentioned together, though they represent different flows.  
- *Resolution*:  
-- **Donation** = action of giving away clothing to others in the community.  
-- **Recycling** = action of sending clothing to government/private services for textile reuse.  
- *Justification*: Separation maintains clarity between peer-to-peer exchanges and organizational processes.  
- *Concepts*: `Donation` (action), `Recycling` (action).

=== Services and Community
- *Observation*: Mentions of “government services,” “private services,” and “community sharing.”  
- *Issue*: Ambiguity between individuals and organizations as actors.  
- *Resolution*:  
-- **User** = individual participant (donor or claimant).  
-- **Service Provider** = organizational actor (government or private) that manages recycling/donation.  
- *Justification*: Differentiation enables consistent treatment of human vs. institutional participation.  
- *Concepts*: `User` (actor), `Service Provider` (actor).

=== Terminology Resolution
- *Clothes*, *garments*, *items*: standardized as **Clothing Item**.  
- *Donation* vs. *Recycling*: separated to reflect community exchange vs. institutional process.  
- *Users* vs. *Services*: clarified as **User** (individual) and **Service Provider** (organization).  

=== Conclusion
The domain analysis produced a clear vocabulary:  
- `Clothing Item` as the primary entity.  
- `Donation` and `Recycling` as distinct actions.  
- `User` and `Service Provider` as actors.

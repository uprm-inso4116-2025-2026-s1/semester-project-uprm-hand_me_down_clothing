=== *3.1 Concept Formation and Analysis*

This section documents how the concepts identified in *2.1.2 – Terminology* emerged from the raw observations and examples in *2.1.1 – Domain Rough Sketch*.  
It clarifies how individual, context-specific details were abstracted into general domain entities, events, functions, and behaviors.  
The goal is to make the reasoning behind each abstraction traceable and verifiable.

==== From Observation to Abstraction

The first stories in the rough sketch (Adriana’s search and Manuel’s donation) revealed a repeating structure of discovery, communication, and exchange.  
By comparing these scenarios side-by-side, the team recognized several recurring phenomena:

* Listings (Facebook posts, WhatsApp messages) act as public representations of clothing items.  
* Buyers and sellers interact through short, informal text exchanges that express *interest* and confirm details.  
* The actual hand-off happens offline, after mutual agreement.  
* Trust is maintained through norms such as showing garment tags, using bilingual communication, and meeting in visible places.

These repeated elements were abstracted into domain concepts — *Listing*, *Buyer*, *Seller*, *Interest Expressed*, *Condition Disclosure Norm*, and *Meetup Practice*.  
Each concept reflects a consistent pattern observed in multiple exchanges, rather than a one-off anecdote.

==== Entity Consolidation

Multiple items described in the examples (e.g., “blazer,” “shirts”) suggested a single core entity: **Piece**, representing any individual clothing item in circulation.  
The posts and messages that made those items visible became the entity **Listing**, distinct from the physical item itself.  
This separation mirrors how the domain actually functions: a Listing can exist, be updated, or be removed independently of the Piece it describes.

==== Event and Function Identification

Actions observed in the examples were distilled into domain functions:

* `publishListing(Piece, Seller, Locale)` — a seller’s act of making an item visible.  
* `closeListing(Listing, Seller)` — a seller’s act of marking a listing inactive after the offline exchange.

Each function captures a discrete transition in the domain, corresponding to what participants *do* rather than what the platform might later automate.

==== Behavioral Norms and Implicit Concepts

Trust-related practices emerged as implicit but crucial aspects of the domain.  
For instance, showing tags or defects evolved into the **Condition Disclosure Norm**, while bilingual messaging and recognizable names became **Trust Cues**.  
By identifying these implicit elements explicitly, the terminology provides a shared vocabulary that aligns both domain understanding and future requirements.

==== Iterative Refinement

During group analysis sessions, terms were revisited to ensure they described phenomena observable without assuming the existence of a system.  
This distinction kept the domain pure — describing only what happens in the world — while preparing a foundation for requirements in Section 2.2.

In conclusion, the concept analysis bridges the gap between individual real-world stories and the structured domain model.  
It traces how recurring actions, roles, and norms were abstracted into formal concepts that will guide subsequent design and implementation work.

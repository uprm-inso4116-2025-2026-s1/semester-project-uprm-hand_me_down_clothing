=== *3.1 Concept Formation and Analysis*

This section documents how the domain concepts were derived from the raw observations in *2.1.1 – Domain Rough Sketch* and the everyday practices described in   *2.1.4 – Domain Narrative*. It explains how concrete, context-specific details were abstracted into entities, events, roles, value objects, actions, and behaviors.   The goal is to show a clear and verifiable path from observation to domain model.

==== From Observation to Abstraction

The rough sketch stories revealed a recurring structure across different individuals: someone makes an item visible to others, potential takers discover it, a brief conversation follows, and the parties meet in person to complete the exchange.   Although the exact tools vary (group chats, social media posts, direct messaging), the underlying phenomena remain consistent.

Several recurring patterns emerged:

* People show items using posts or photos that function as temporary “public signals.”
* Interested parties initiate contact with short, informal messages asking if the item
  is still available.
* Agreement is reached by clarifying small details (size, condition, pickup spot).
* The exchange occurs at a familiar physical location.
* After the handoff, the item is no longer advertised, and the original post is often
  updated or removed.
* Positive or negative experiences influence future interactions through informal
  reputation.

Because these behaviors appeared across multiple narratives, the team abstracted them into stable domain concepts rather than anecdotal exceptions.

==== Consolidating Entities

The physical objects (“shirts,” “blazer,” “backpack,” etc.) were generalized into the entity **Piece**, representing any clothing item circulating in the community.

In contrast, the posts, messages, or shared images that made these items visible were abstracted into **Listings**—representational artifacts distinct from the Pieces they describe. This distinction was necessary because Listings have their own lifecycle: they can appear, be updated, be ignored, or be removed independently of the Piece.

This separation mirrors what happens in real exchanges: the representation moves through visibility states while the underlying item simply exists.

==== Identifying Events and Actions

Certain moments in the narratives corresponded to discrete transitions:

* when an item becomes publicly visible  
* when someone expresses interest  
* when the availability of the item changes  

These transitions were abstracted into **Events** such as *Listing Published*, *Interest Expressed*, and *Listing Closed*.   Each event marks an instantaneous change observed in participant behavior.

The human activities that lead to these events—posting an item, contacting someone, removing a post—became **Actions**. This separation allowed the model to differentiate between *what people do* and *what changes occur in the domain* as a result.

==== Behavioral Norms and Implicit Practices

The rough sketches contained implicit social rules that shape exchanges even though they are rarely stated explicitly.

Several of these norms recurred across different stories:

* **Condition Disclosure Norm** — participants often show wear, defects, or tags before exchanging items.
* **Meetup Practice** — exchanges consistently occur in familiar, visible locations, often near the UPRM campus.
* **Trust Cues** — people rely on conversational tone, mutual acquaintances, bilingual communication, or recognizable names.
* **Student Resale Price Band** — symbolic or low-cost pricing appeared repeatedly in student-to-student transactions.
* **Exchange Flow** — the behavioral pattern “share → discover → contact → meet” formed a recognizable structure across all accounts.
* **Reuse Loop** — items sometimes re-enter circulation after a period of use or storage, showing that clothing may undergo multiple listing cycles.

These implicit behaviors were made explicit to accurately reflect the lived domain and to ensure future requirements align with local social practices rather than imposing new ones.

==== Roles, Settings, and Value Objects

Observations showed that participants shift roles depending on context. Someone who gives away an item one week may seek another the next. These shifting positions were abstracted as the roles **Buyer** and **Seller**, not as fixed categories of people.

Exchanges consistently took place at physical locations such as campus entries, bus stops, or parking lots. These stable spatial anchors were captured as **Settings** under the term **Locale**.

Repeated references to size, type, and condition formed the basis for **Value Objects** such as **Type**, **Condition Rating**, and other descriptive attributes that help people assess suitability quickly.

==== Iterative Refinement

As concepts solidified, the team rechecked them against the narratives to ensure that each abstraction described something observable without assuming any future technical system. Concepts related to visibility, interest, trust, representations, and reuse were reshaped until they represented domain truths rather than system intentions.

This iterative process ensured that the domain model remained faithful to real-world behaviors while providing a structured foundation for the requirements and design work in Section 2.2.

In summary, the concept formation process bridges concrete stories and abstract structures. It documents how repeated behaviors, roles, events, and norms were distilled into a coherent domain model that guides subsequent architectural and design decisions.

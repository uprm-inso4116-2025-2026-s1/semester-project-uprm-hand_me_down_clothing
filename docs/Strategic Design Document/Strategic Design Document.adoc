== 1. Domain Overview

Hand-Me-Down is a campus-focused clothing marketplace where users list, browse, favorite, and purchase second-hand clothing items. The platform emphasizes community, sustainability, and an accessible, cozy experience.

== 2. Subdomain Classification

It divides a large domain into meaningful subdomains based on business importance and technical complexity.

=== Core Subdomain

* *Listing & Discovery*
** Upload clothing items with pictures, sizes, category, and condition.
** Search & filter by type, size, condition, gender.

* *Trust & Community Experience*
** Friendly UI and listing cards for a “borrow from a friend” feeling.
** Communicating sustainability and re-use value.
** UX decisions focused on safety and connection.

=== Supporting Subdomains

* *Favorites & Saved Items*
** Users save items they like.
** Helps retention and decision making.

* *User Profiles*
** Name, profile picture, basic preferences.
** Helps personalize discovery.

* *Messaging / Contact Seller*
** Simple “contact seller” conversation.
** Enables purchases (supporting, not core).

=== Generic Subdomains

* *Authentication*
** Sign-up, login, passwords, isLoggedIn.
** Often outsourced.

* *Payments*
** Stripe or any standard card payment flow.

* *Database Layer*
** Supabase / SQL table definitions.

* *Logging / Monitoring*
** Internal system concerns, invisible to users.

_Why generic?_  
These are universal across systems and do not provide domain-specific competitive advantage.

== 5. Why This Strategic Design Works

=== A. Modularity
Each bounded context has separate responsibilities, preventing large, monolithic models.

=== B. Independence
One context can be developed or modified without breaking others.

=== C. Ubiquitous Language
Terms maintain consistent meaning inside their respective boundaries.

== 6. Evaluation / Testing

* *Modularity:*  
  Each context has isolated responsibilities.

* *Independence:*  
  Modifying one context does not break others.

* *Ubiquitous Language:*  
  Each term is well-defined and consistent.

[abstract]
This document explains how category and condition filters interact with global search while adhering to Separation of Concerns and High Cohesion. It captures guiding principles, interaction rules, and a concise testing plan to validate behavior.

== Principles
- Separation of Concerns: Search (free text) is decoupled from categorical filters (category, condition, etc.).
- High Cohesion: Each filter component owns its responsibility and exposes a clear, minimal interface.

== Interaction Rules
- Global search applies case-insensitive partial matching across user-facing text fields.
- Category and condition filters constrain results orthogonally to search.
- When both are present, results must satisfy filters first, then match search terms.

== Testing Plan
- Unit tests: repository-level search + filter composition.
- Integration tests: UI form submits with combined filters and search.
- Edge cases: empty search, long inputs, invalid categories/conditions.

If this replaced an older doc, its filename was `filter-search-interaction.adoc`. The content here reflects the updated naming and focus.

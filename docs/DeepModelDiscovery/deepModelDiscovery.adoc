== Objective
Show how refining our project's domain reveals deeper abstractions and relationships between core concepts.

== Overview
This document examines the main domain concepts in the *Hand Me Down Clothing* project and refines them to uncover the deeper models they represent.  
By exploring *why* and *how* each concept exists, we reveal the hidden structures that guide the systemâ€™s logic and business rules.

== Concept 1: Listing

*Before:*  
A *Listing* is a post where a user describes an item they want to sell or donate.

*After:*  
A *Listing* represents an **Ownership & Trust Transfer Offer**, a structured proposal to transfer possession of an item under defined conditions (sale or donation).

*Implications:*  

- Listings expire because offers are temporary.  
- Verification and reporting exist to manage trust in ownership transfers.  
- Donations and sales share the same transfer abstraction with different transaction rules.

== Concept 2: Seller

*Before:*  
A *Seller* is a user who creates listings to sell or donate items.

*After:*  
A *Seller* is an **Ownership Initiator**, an actor responsible for initiating a transfer of ownership and providing trustworthy information about the item.

*Implications:*  

- Sellers must be identifiable and credible to preserve marketplace trust.  
- Reputation, history, and verification systems stem from this responsibility model.  
- System permissions (e.g., who can post or edit listings) align with ownership control.

== Concept 3: Buyer

*Before:*  
A *Buyer* is a user browsing or purchasing items through listings.

*After:*  
A *Buyer* is an **Ownership Receiver**, an actor who accepts the transfer of ownership and verifies item authenticity through the listing data.

*Implications:*  

- Buyers rely on listing transparency (photos, condition) for trust validation.  
- Review and feedback systems emerge from this verification role.  
- Buyer experience flows center on evaluating and confirming ownership transfers.

== Concept 4: Item

*Before:*  
An *Item* is a piece of clothing being sold or donated.

*After:*  
An *Item* is a **Transferable Asset**, an entity with a defined state (available, pending, transferred) that moves through ownership cycles in the system.

*Implications:*  

- Database models should track ownership state transitions.  
- Items may be reused in multiple listings if relisted.  
- The system must preserve item history to maintain trust and traceability.

== Concept 5: Listing Type (Sell vs Donate)

*Before:*  
Listings can be one of two types: *Sell* or *Donate*.

*After:*  
Listing types represent **Transaction Modes**, alternative paths for executing ownership transfers, differing in exchange value rather than structure.

*Implications:*  

- Core logic remains the same (transfer of ownership), but business rules differ (payment required vs. free).  
- Both flows can share a unified API with mode-specific conditions.  
- Analytics can compare engagement across transaction modes.

== Concept 6: Category and Tags (Metadata)

*Before:*  
Categories and tags help users filter and discover listings.

*After:*  
They represent a **Semantic Discovery Layer**, a structured vocabulary that links user intent (search) to inventory data.

*Implications:*  

- Improves search relevance and personalization.  
- Metadata supports domain-level reasoning (e.g., seasonal clothing trends, sustainability tracking).  
- Validation rules ensure consistent data input.

== Concept 7: Photo and Condition

*Before:*  
Photos and condition fields provide visual and descriptive details about an item.

*After:*  
They function as **Trust Signals**, domain mechanisms that communicate authenticity, quality, and reliability between users.

*Implications:*  

- System enforces minimum photo quality and required condition fields.  
- Machine learning or moderation tools can later evaluate trust signals automatically.  
- Buyer satisfaction metrics correlate with trust signal quality.

== Key Insight
Across all concepts, the deeper domain model reveals that *Hand Me Down Clothing* is not merely a platform for posting clothing items, it is a **trust-based ownership transfer system**.  
Every feature, from listings to photos, contributes to maintaining fairness, reliability, and traceability in these transfers.

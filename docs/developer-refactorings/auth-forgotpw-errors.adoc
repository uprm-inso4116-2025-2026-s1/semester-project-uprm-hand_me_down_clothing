Forgot Password link and Auth Error Handling Improvements

This change implements two related improvements to the authentication UX and error handling:

1. Wire the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page to the reset flow.
2. Centralize and map Supabase auth errors to friendlier messages, with lightweight logging.

Files changed

- `source_code/app/Login/page.tsx`
- `source_code/app/auth/reset_password_request/page.tsx`
- `source_code/app/auth/auth.ts` (auth helpers)
- `source_code/app/auth/errorMapper.ts` (new helper)
- `source_code/tests/unit/auth_errors.test.ts` (new tests)

 What I changed

- Login page: converted the static "Forgot Password?" text into a real link that navigates to `/auth/reset_password_request` so users can request a reset email.
- Reset password page: improved success/error feedback, added `aria-live` attributes for screen reader announcements, and extra guidance (check spam, retry guidance).
- Auth helpers: added `errorMapper.ts` and integrated it into `auth.ts`. All helper functions now log errors with `console.error` and return an error object whose `message` field is a friendly, mapped string. This keeps UI pages simple (they can display `error.message`) while providing predictable wording.
- Tests: added unit tests that mock `supabase.auth` to assert that rate-limit and invalid credentials errors are mapped to friendly messages.

Why this helps

- Users get clear, actionable feedback when reset emails fail or when sign-in fails.
- Developers have a single place to update error mapping and integrate structured logging or monitoring later.

 Next steps

- Extend the error mappings (e.g., map specific Supabase codes) as we encounter real error payloads.
- Replace `console.error` with a proper monitoring integration (Sentry) in production.
- Add integration/UI tests for the reset flow in the browser (RTL / Playwright) to validate accessible feedback.

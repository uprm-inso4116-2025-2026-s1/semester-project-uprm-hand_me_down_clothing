Lecture Topic Task # 311: Entities and Value Objects in the Hand-Me-Down
Project Assignee: Daniella Melero Milestone 3 In the Hand-Me-Down
clothing marketplace, several domain objects illustrate the distinction
between Entities and Value Objects. Entities are defined by a continuous
identity that persists even as their attributes change, while Value
Objects are defined purely by their properties and are interchangeable
when their values are equal. 
1. Listing – Entity A Listing represents a
posted item for sale, such as “Green UPR hoodie, size M, $15.” Identity
continuity is essential because each listing has its own lifecycle and
interactions, such as views, messages, and status updates. Even if the
description, photos, or price are edited, the system must still
recognize it as the same listing for analytics, favorites, and
transactions. In software, this would be modeled with a stable
identifier, for example Listing ++{++ id, sellerId, title, price,
condition, status }, where equality depends on the id, not the mutable
attributes. 
2. User Account – Entity A User is a core participant in the
system and must maintain a consistent identity across time. A user may
change their profile picture or email, yet their identity remains
constant to preserve history such as ratings, orders, and chat records.
This persistence makes the User an Entity, typically modeled as User
++{++ id, name, email, rating, … }, where userId is the primary key
ensuring the same individual is recognized even after attribute updates.
3. Order / Transaction – Entity An Order or Transaction documents the
agreement between a buyer and a seller. Identity continuity matters
because each transaction can evolve through multiple states: created,
pending payment, completed, or canceled. Each order’s events,
confirmations, refunds, or disputes—must link to the same transaction
identity. This would be represented in software as Order (id, buyerId,
sellerId, listingId, status, paymentInfo), with the id ensuring event
consistency over time. 
4. Money / Price – Value Object Money or Price
captures an amount and currency (e.g., $15 USD). Its value alone defines
equality; two Money objects with the same amount and currency are
indistinguishable. Identity continuity is irrelevant since $15 USD is
always exchangeable with any other $15 USD. Modeled as Money (amount,
currency), it is immutable and replaced when a price changes rather than
updated in place. 
5. Item Condition – Value Object ItemCondition
expresses the qualitative state of a product (e.g., New, Like New, Good,
Fair). This classification has no independent identity—it merely
describes a property of a listing. When a seller changes an item’s
condition, the previous value is replaced rather than modified.
Implemented as an enumeration such as enum ItemCondition (NEW,
LIKE++_++NEW, GOOD, FAIR ), equality depends entirely on the literal
value, not on any unique identifier. Reflection and Peer Review During
peer review, classifications can be challenged by re-examining whether
an object’s identity must persist. For example, an Address could
initially be treated as a Value Object (copied into each order), but if
the team later decides that users can manage and update saved addresses
independently, it might instead be modeled as an Entity. The guiding
principle remains: If the object’s lifecycle or history matters, it is
an Entity. If only its descriptive properties matter, it is a Value
Object.

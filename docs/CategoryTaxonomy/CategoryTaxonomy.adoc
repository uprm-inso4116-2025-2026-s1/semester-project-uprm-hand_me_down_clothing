= Category Taxonomy & Standardization for Listings

== Objective
Define a clear, standardized category structure for **Sell** and **Donate** listings that improves discoverability, user experience, and future scalability of the platform.

== Description
* Research how established marketplaces structure their categories and subcategories.
* Identify common category patterns across platforms.
* Determine differences in category depth for selling vs. donating.
* Recommend a taxonomy proposal that balances:
  ** Ease of navigation for users
  ** Flexibility for future growth
  ** Compatibility with search/filter features
* Document examples of potential categories and subcategories for our platform.

== Platforms Analyzed
* **eBay**
* **Facebook Marketplace (Meta)**
* **OfferUp**
* **Craigslist**
* **Goodwill (Donation)**

== Differences Between Sell and Donate Categories
- Sell listings have more detailed subcategories to optimize discovery and filtering for buyers.
- Donate listings prioritize simplicity to reduce friction for donors and focus on main item types.
- Donate flow emphasizes condition, pickup/dropoff, and donation acceptance guidelines.
- Naming conventions may differ slightly to align with user expectations (e.g., "Kitchenware" vs. "Kitchen").

== Recommendations for Search & Filtering
- Use main categories as primary filters.
- Subcategories enable more precise filtering in advanced search.
- Include category-specific attributes (brand, size, condition) to power faceted search.
- Support synonyms and aliasing (e.g., "sofa" → "couch").
- Maintain a flexible taxonomy to allow adding new categories without restructuring.
- Provide category auto-suggestions during listing creation to reduce miscategorization.

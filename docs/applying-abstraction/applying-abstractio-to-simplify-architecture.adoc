// LTT: Applying Abstraction to a Real System

== Why Applying Abstraction in the Design Process Is Important

Applying abstraction in the design process allows us to simplify complex systems by focusing only on the essential details while hiding unnecessary implementation specifics. For the Hand-Me-Down Clothing application, abstraction is crucial because it enables us to divide the platform into meaningful, manageable components that represent real-world concepts without overwhelming the design with technical complexity.

= Reducing Complexity Through Abstraction in the Hand-Me-Down Clothing Platform

== BEFORE Abstraction
The initial system design contained a large set of intertwined features without clear roles or boundaries. Every requirement coexisted in a single conceptual space, causing confusion and architectural overload.

| Hand-Me-Down Clothing System (Before Abstraction)    |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| User Registration/Login                              |
| Manage Parent Profiles                               |
| Create, Edit, Delete Listings                        |
| Clothing Size, Condition, Seasons                    |
| Sell or Donate Clothing                              |
| Search by Category                                   |
| Favorites / Saved Items                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
....

*Problem:*  
Every feature appears equal in importance. No conceptual grouping exists.  
The system offers no guidance for where new features should belong.

== APPLYING ABSTRACTION
Abstraction groups related responsibilities into meaningful architectural contexts:

* Authentication ↦ identity, access, user sessions  
* Listings ↦ items offered for sale or donation  
* Communication ↦ messages, pickup coordination

Instead of dealing with **everything at once**, abstraction elevates our view so we only see essential structures.

== AFTER Abstraction

                   +----------------------+
                   | Authentication       |
                   |----------------------|
                   | Register/Login       |
                   | User Identity        |
                   | Roles & Permissions  |
                   +----------+-----------+
                              |
                              |  
                      +---------------| 
                        | Listings                       
                |------------------------------|  
                | Create Sell/Donate Listing   |  
                | Clothing Size/Condition      | 
                | Search & Categories          |  
                | Favorites                    |  
                +------------------------------+
....

*Result:*  
The platform now has **three well-defined modules**, each with a clear set of responsibilities.

== Abstraction Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Number of conceptual modules | 1 | 3 |
| Responsibility clarity | Low | High |
| Coupling | High & accidental | Explicit & intentional |
| Scalability | Difficult | Structured & extendable |
| Cognitive load | Overwhelming | Manageable |

---

== Explanation of Abstraction
Abstraction removed unnecessary detail from the early architecture and allowed the system to be understood in terms of **what** it does, not **how** it implements it. Instead of a tangled list of features, we now have three conceptual building blocks, each representing a focused responsibility within the clothing reuse ecosystem.

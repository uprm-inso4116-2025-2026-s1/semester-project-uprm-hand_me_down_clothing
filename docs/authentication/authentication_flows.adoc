= Authentication Flows (Supabase)

== Overview
This document describes how password reset and email verification are implemented in the Hand-Me-Down Clothing platform using Supabase Auth.

== Password Reset Workflow
* Users request a password reset from the login page.
* Supabase sends a password reset email with a magic link.
* After clicking the link, users are directed to a form to set a new password.
* Backend logic: see `source_code/app/auth/auth.ts` (`requestPasswordReset`, `updatePassword`).

== Email Verification Workflow
* New users receive a verification email after sign-up.
* Email verification is automatic via Supabase magic links.
* Verification status can be checked with `getUser()` and inspecting `user.email_confirmed_at`.

== Implementation Reference
* See `source_code/app/auth/` for backend functions and UI forms.

= Remember Me (Session Persistence)

The application supports a "Remember me" option at sign-in that controls whether the authentication session is persisted across browser restarts.

Implementation details:

* A small storage adapter (`app/auth/storage.ts`) chooses between `localStorage` (persistent) and `sessionStorage` (non-persistent) based on a user preference flag.
* The flag is set when the user checks "Remember me" on sign-in (`setAuthPersistence(true)`), and cleared otherwise.
* Supabase client is configured to use the custom storage adapter (`app/auth/supabaseClient.ts`).
* This approach avoids server-side state changes while providing an explicit UX control for persistence.

Security considerations:

* Persistent sessions increase the risk if a device is shared; clearly label the option and recommend using it only on personal devices.
* The storage flag is stored in `localStorage`; the adapter will store session tokens in `sessionStorage` when "Remember me" is disabled.
* Optionally pair with device recognition or allow users to view and revoke active sessions from their account settings.

# Hand-Me-Down Clothing Platform

## üìñ Introduction  
This project aims to develop a **hand-me-down clothing platform** that promotes sustainability, affordability, and community sharing. The application enables individuals to **browse, donate, claim, or recycle clothing items**, as well as connect with government and private services that support textile reuse and recycling. By providing an accessible digital space, the platform contributes to reducing textile pollution while making clothing more affordable and widely available.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Improve affordability** by enabling access to free or low-cost clothing.  
- **Foster community sharing** by connecting individuals with services and organizations.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend / Database:** To be determined (potentially PostgreSQL)  
- **Other tools/services:** TBD as development progresses

# Hand-Me-Down Clothing Platform

## üìñ Introduction  
This project aims to develop a **hand-me-down clothing platform** that promotes sustainability, affordability, and community sharing. The application enables individuals to **browse, donate, claim, or recycle clothing items**, as well as connect with government and private services that support textile reuse and recycling. By providing an accessible digital space, the platform contributes to reducing textile pollution while making clothing more affordable and widely available.

## üéØ Project Goals  
- **Reduce textile waste** by extending the life cycle of clothing.  
- **Promote sustainability** through donations and recycling.  
- **Improve affordability** by enabling access to free or low-cost clothing.  
- **Foster community sharing** by connecting individuals with services and organizations.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend / Database:** To be determined (potentially PostgreSQL)  
- **Other tools/services:** TBD as development progresses  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Installation instructions will be finalized once backend and database choices are confirmed.  
Currently, the general process is:  
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/uprm-inso4116-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-uprm-hand_me_down_clothing.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd semester-project-uprm-hand_me_down_clothing

# Install dependencies (exact command TBD)
npm install

# Start development server (exact command TBD)
npm start
```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions  
Once running, users will be able to:  
1. **Login or Sign up** to create an account.  
2. **Browse clothing items** available on the platform.  
3. **Add items** they wish to donate.

# 📝 Title  
<!-- Short, clear summary of the task -->  
Example: Implement Accessibility Testing for the Login & Sign-Up Process  

---

## 🎯 Objective

## 📄 Description  
<!-- Detailed explanation of what needs to be done. Include requirements if possible. -->  
- UI elements must be properly labeled and accessible via screen readers.  
- Forms should be fully navigable via keyboard.  
- Maintain proper contrast ratios and color usage.  
- Error messages and status updates must be conveyed to assistive technology.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria  
<!-- List clear, testable conditions that must be met for the issue to be considered complete -->  
- All input fields and interactive elements are screen reader-friendly.  
- The login and sign-up process is fully navigable using only a keyboard.

## 🧪 Testing Plan  
<!-- Outline how this feature/bug fix will be tested -->  
1. Ensure input fields have appropriate labels (`aria-label` or `<label>`).  
2. Verify interactive elements are reachable via tab navigation and show clear focus indicators.  
3. Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).  
4. Check color contrast (≥ 4.5:1 for normal text, ≥ 3:1 for large text).  
5. Confirm error messages include text, not just color.  
6. Validate that form messages are announced automatically by screen readers.  
7. Run automated tools: axe DevTools, Lighthouse, WAVE.  
8. Conduct manual tests with high contrast and reduced motion enabled.  
9. Generate an accessibility audit report.
